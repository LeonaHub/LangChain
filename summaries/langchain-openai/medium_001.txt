PyTorch is an open-source deep-learning library developed by Facebook's AI research lab in 2016. It is based on Python and Torch, offering a versatile platform for building and training neural networks in various domains like computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and reinforcement learning. PyTorch features a dynamic computational graph that allows developers to construct and modify graphs on the go, enabling intuitive model creation, easier debugging, and architectural experimentation. The library integrates smoothly with the Python ecosystem for simplified code development and interoperability with other frameworks. Additionally, PyTorch includes TorchVision for tasks like image classification using pre-trained models such as ResNet or VGG.

On the other hand, TensorFlow is an open-source machine-learning platform developed by Google that offers tools for developing and deploying machine learning models across multiple platforms including mobile devices. TensorFlow revolves around computational graphs where developers define mathematical computations as interconnected nodes representing operations or variables. It supports various neural network architectures like CNNs, RNNs, transformers along with APIs for reinforcement learning NLP time series analysis.

Both PyTorch and TensorFlow have vibrant communities providing resources tutorials pre-trained models to support users of all levels in utilizing their capabilities effectively.
