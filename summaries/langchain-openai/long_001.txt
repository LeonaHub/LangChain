The text discusses the optical activity of ionized tyrosyl residues in ovine lutropin, a glycoprotein hormone produced by the anterior pituitary gland. The hormone consists of two subunits, a and p, with specific tyrosyl residues and disulfides. Studies on the CD spectra of lutropin at different pH levels show contributions from tyrosyl residues to specific regions. Investigations into the effects of tyrosine ionization on CD spectra were conducted to understand their contribution to overall spectral patterns. Various derivatives and subunits were prepared for analysis using spectroscopy techniques like CD and absorption/difference spectra measurements. Results indicate that changes in near-ultraviolet CD spectra are due to ionization of exposed tyrosines, particularly a21, a92, and 93 contributing significantly to optical activity in this region. Far-ultraviolet CD data showed minor changes indicating no significant alterations in main chain conformation among compounds studied.

The study also delves into secondary structure estimations based on far-ultraviolet CD data for lutropin derivatives showing similar contents across samples with slight differences observed between native lutropin/subunits compared to des-(92-96)-lutropin variants or recombinants.

Overall findings suggest that variations in intensity within certain bands can be attributed to specific exposed or buried tyrosyl residues impacting biological activities such as testosterone production stimulation by collagenase-dispersed rat Leydig cells.
