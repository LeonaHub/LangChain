Economists predict that the US economy added 190,000 jobs in June, a decrease from the previous month's gain of 272,000. Despite this slight pullback, there are signs that the economy is slowing down with decreasing consumer spending and worker insecurity. The upcoming job report will be crucial in determining if the job market is stable or weaker than expected. Economists believe that as long as job gains continue to gradually cool off, it indicates a healthy economy; however, a steep decline would be concerning.
