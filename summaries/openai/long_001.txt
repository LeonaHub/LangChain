PyTorch and TensorFlow are two major deep-learning frameworks that have gained popularity among data scientists, machine learning engineers, and researchers due to their ease of use, scalability with complexity, and open-source nature. PyTorch is developed by Facebook's AI research lab and offers flexibility for building models in computer vision, NLP, and reinforcement learning. On the other hand, TensorFlow by Google provides a comprehensive suite of tools for developing machine learning models with extensive community support.

Deep learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn complex patterns from data. It uses neural networks modeled after human brains to process information efficiently.

When comparing PyTorch vs TensorFlow vs Keras:

- PyTorch offers dynamic computational graphs allowing modifications on the go while providing efficient GPU acceleration.
- TensorFlow focuses on static graph computations but excels in handling larger datasets efficiently.
- Keras is a high-level API running on top of TensorFlow or other backends like Theano or CNTK offering simplicity in designing neural networks.

Each framework has its pros and cons: Pytorch is beginner-friendly but less widely used; Tensorflow has excellent documentation but can be challenging for beginners; Keras provides an intuitive API but may face low-level backend errors.

Ultimately, the choice between these frameworks depends on project requirements such as flexibility needed during model training (Pytorch), large dataset handling (TensorFlow), or quick model development (Keras).
