The text discusses the optical activity of ionized tyrosyl residues in ovine lutropin, a glycoprotein hormone produced by the anterior pituitary gland. The hormone consists of two subunits, a and p, with specific tyrosyl residues and disulfides. Studies on the CD spectra of lutropin at different pH levels show contributions from tyrosyl residues to specific regions. Investigations into the effects of tyrosine ionization on CD spectra were conducted to understand their contribution to overall spectral patterns. Various derivatives and subunits were prepared for analysis using spectroscopy techniques like CD and absorption spectroscopy at different pH levels. Results indicate that changes in near-ultraviolet CD spectra are due to ionization of exposed tyrosyl residues, particularly those in positions 21, 92, and 93 contributing significantly to optical activity observed in ovine lutropin's spectrum at alkaline pH values. The study also highlights differences between native lutropin and its recombinant forms based on secondary structure content estimates obtained from far-ultraviolet CD data analysis.

In summary:
- Ovine lutropin is a glycoprotein hormone with two subunits (a and p) containing specific tyrosyl residues.
- Changes in near-ultraviolet CD spectra are attributed to ionization of exposed tyrosines.
- Differences between native lutropin and recombinant forms are observed based on secondary structure content estimates.
- Studies provide insights into how specific amino acid residues contribute to the optical activity observed in ovine lutropin's spectrum under varying conditions such as different pH levels or structural modifications like recombination or derivatization.
