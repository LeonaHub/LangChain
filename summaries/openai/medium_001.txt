PyTorch is an open-source deep-learning library developed by Facebook's AI research lab in 2016. It is based on Python and Torch, offering a versatile platform for building and training neural networks in various domains like computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and reinforcement learning. PyTorch's key features include a dynamic computational graph for flexible model creation, easy debugging, and architectural experimentation. It integrates smoothly with the Python ecosystem and provides GPU acceleration for faster computations. The active PyTorch community offers extensive support resources to aid users in utilizing the library effectively.

TensorFlow, on the other hand, is an open-source machine-learning platform created by Google that offers tools for developing and deploying machine learning models efficiently. TensorFlow revolves around computational graphs where developers define mathematical computations as interconnected nodes representing operations or variables. It supports various neural network architectures like CNNs, RNNs, transformers along with APIs for reinforcement learning, NLP tasks among others. TensorFlow also leverages hardware acceleration such as GPUs and TPUs to expedite computations leading to faster training of deep learning models when working with large datasets.

Both PyTorch and TensorFlow have vibrant communities providing tutorials/resources making them accessible platforms catering to both beginners & experienced developers interested in deep learning applications.
