June’s monthly job gains should remain strong and steady, but gradually cooling: Economists expect the US economy added 190,000 jobs last month, a pullback from the stronger-than-expected 272,000 gain in May.

Still, there’s a growing chorus of data that shows the economy is slowing, consumer spending is letting up and workers are feeling less secure.

As such, Friday’s report could provide a crucial signal as to whether the jobs market is at a stable or even pre-pandemic state — or is perhaps weaker than advertised.

“I think as long as the job gains continue to show a gradual cooling, this economy is in good shape,” said Nela Richardson, ADP’s chief economist, during a call with reporters on Wednesday following the payroll processor’s latest report showing job and wage gains slowed in the private sector.

ADP estimated that private employers added 150,000 jobs last month, down from 157,000 in May.

“If we see the cooldown go from gradual to steep, I think that’s a warning,” she said.
