What is PyTorch?
PyTorch is an open-source deep-learning library based on Python and Torch. It provides a versatile platform for building and training neural networks in computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and reinforcement learning.

Developed in 2016 by Facebook’s AI research lab, PyTorch has gained popularity, providing researchers and developers with a flexible and efficient framework for constructing and training deep learning models. It has grown popular due to its simplicity of use, intuitive API, extensibility, scalability, and ability to support production deployment.

Features
A distinctive feature of PyTorch is its dynamic computational graph, allowing developers to construct and modify graphs on the go. Unlike static graph-based frameworks, this flexibility enables intuitive model creation, easier debugging, and architectural experimentation.

Developers can quickly iterate on ideas with minimal overhead. Additionally, it enables researchers to replicate experiments and create new ones from scratch easily.

PyTorch’s Pythonic style integrates smoothly with the Python ecosystem, leveraging its libraries and tools for simplified code development, debugging, and interoperability with other frameworks.
