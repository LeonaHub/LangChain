Acetabular fractures, often caused by high-energy injuries, are typically treated with open reduction and internal fixation. Surgical approaches like the ilioinguinal and modified Stoppa are commonly used for anterior acetabular fractures. The ilioinguinal approach fully exposes the anterior column without affecting hip abductors, allowing for early rehabilitation. The Stoppa approach, introduced by Stoppa in 1969, simplifies traditional methods but has limitations. The pararectus approach, a modification of the Stoppa, offers better exposure for severe fractures, especially in obese patients. A study comparing the pararectus and ilioinguinal approaches found no significant differences in patient demographics but varied in incision length and exposure time. Both approaches showed similar postoperative hip function scores. The pararectus approach is preferred for anterior acetabular fractures due to its advantages in visualization and reduced soft tissue damage. It involves five windows to minimize nerve and blood vessel damage. However, it has limitations such as muscle atrophy risk and potential peritoneum damage. Surgeons must be cautious of abdominal anatomy to avoid complications. The study's limitations include a small sample size and short follow-up time, suggesting the need for further monitoring for long-term efficacy assessment.
