Comparative genome sequencing reveals that closely related organisms have similar total gene numbers, but differences exist in specific genes due to gains and losses through evolution. Gene duplication and loss play crucial roles in evolution, with challenges in accurately studying gene gain and loss at a genome-wide level. Methods like comparing species trees to gene trees are used to infer gene gains and losses, but limitations exist, such as errors in tree construction and biases in tree reconciliation methods. These biases can lead to incorrect inferences about gene evolution, particularly in vertebrates. The text discusses how biases in tree reconciliation methods can impact the estimation of gene duplications and losses, especially towards the tips of the tree. The study suggests that biases in tree reconciliation methods may have influenced past research on vertebrate genome evolution. The text emphasizes the importance of accurately determining gene duplicates on specific branches of a species tree and highlights the challenges in studying copy number evolution in vertebrate genomes. It suggests that improvements in gene trees, more data, or simulations may be needed to better understand the evolution of vertebrate genomes.
