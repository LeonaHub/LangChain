The text discusses the entry process of Avian Sarcoma and Leukosis Virus (ASLV) into cells, focusing on endocytosis, acid-dependent conformational changes in the virus envelope protein (Env), and fusion completion. The study used imaging assays to show a delay in low pH-induced fusion steps of ASLV in certain cell types due to pH regulation in early endosomes. The research also found that the virus restriction factor IFITM3 inhibited ASLV fusion, with different effects in different cell types. The study analyzed the steps involved in ASLV fusion, including receptor-mediated priming of Env and low pH-dependent refolding of the viral protein. The text also discusses the impact of endosomal pH on ASLV fusion probability and kinetics, as well as the role of factors like temperature and endosomal lipids and proteins in viral fusion. The study highlights the importance of regulating endosomal pH for the entry and fusion of ASLV and other viruses that undergo acid-induced fusion. The text also mentions the use of specific inhibitors and imaging techniques to study the fusion kinetics of ASLV with different cell types expressing various receptor isoforms. Additionally, the text describes the impact of IFITM3 expression on ASLV fusion, endocytosis rates, and endosomal pH levels in different cell types. The study emphasizes the influence of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on viral fusion efficiency and the need for further research to understand the complex mechanisms involved in virus-cell fusion.
