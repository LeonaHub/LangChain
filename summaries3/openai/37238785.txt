The Maillard reaction is a non-enzymatic process that occurs at high temperatures when amino groups react with carbonyl groups on reducing sugars, forming advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) like CML, CEL, and acrylamide. AGEs are compounds formed during food processing and in the body, with accumulation linked to various diseases. Dietary restriction of AGEs in animals can prevent disorders like atherosclerosis and renal injury. Acrylamide, a probable carcinogen, forms during Maillard reactions at temperatures above 120Â°C. Plant-based meat analogs (PBMA) are popular alternatives that use extrusion technology to create a meat-like texture. PBMA production can lead to the formation of harmful compounds like CML, CEL, and acrylamide. Studies have shown varying levels of these compounds in PBMA, with factors like protein, amino acids, and sugars influencing their formation. The text details methods for analyzing CML, CEL, and acrylamide in PBMA, highlighting the importance of reducing these compounds during production. PBMA also vary in protein content, amino acid profile, fatty acid composition, and sugar content, with correlations found between these components and the formation of harmful compounds. Future research aims to understand the mechanisms and strategies to reduce the formation of CML, CEL, and acrylamide in PBMA.
