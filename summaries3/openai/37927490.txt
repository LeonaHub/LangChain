Lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the SLC7A7 gene, leading to dysfunction of the y + LAT‐1 protein transporter. Patients with LPI can present with various symptoms, including renal tubular acidosis (RTA), Fanconi syndrome, rickets, and kidney disease. Diagnosis of LPI can be challenging due to the lack of specific symptoms, but genetic analysis is crucial for accurate identification. Kidney involvement in LPI often manifests as tubulopathy, proteinuria, and kidney failure, with some patients developing chronic glomerular kidney disease over time. A case study highlighted a patient with RTA/Fanconi syndrome and rickets who was later diagnosed with LPI through genetic analysis. Differentiating LPI from other renal tubular diseases can be difficult, especially in patients without typical symptoms. The text also discusses the importance of informed consent in research and ethical standards in conducting studies.
