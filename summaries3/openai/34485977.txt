The text discusses the increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), including pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep venous thrombosis (DVT), in COVID-19 patients. International guidelines recommend prophylactic anticoagulation for all hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Studies have shown varying rates of VTE in ICU patients, with higher rates in those with severe sepsis and viral infections compared to non-ICU patients. Some studies have shown an increase in PE cases during the COVID-19 pandemic, while others have found no significant increase in VTE prevalence in COVID-19 patients compared to non-COVID-19 patients. A study in Sweden found no difference in VTE incidence between those with a positive SARS‐CoV‐2 test in 2020 compared to previous years. The study suggests that a positive SARS‐CoV‐2 test alone should not determine the need for VTE workup in the emergency department, and other risk factors should be considered. The prevalence of VTE did not increase in the cohort, except for patients in intensive care. The text emphasizes the importance of determining pretest probability before conducting diagnostic tests and mentions that COVID-19 status had minimal impact on VTE risk when adjusting for traditional risk factors. Overall, data from 2015 to 2019 show no significant differences in VTE prevalence in 2020, suggesting a limited impact of the pandemic on VTE testing practices.
