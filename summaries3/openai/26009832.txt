HPTN 052 was a Phase III study involving HIV-1 serodiscordant couples that showed ART could prevent HIV-1 transmission, but adherence to medications is crucial. The study focused on predictors of medication adherence in individuals taking ART for prevention. Participants received adherence counseling and were provided with specific drug combinations. Adherence was assessed through interviews, pill counts, and psychosocial data. The study found that higher adherence levels were associated with viral suppression. Factors influencing adherence included mental health, social support, substance use, and demographic variables. The study highlighted the importance of adherence for achieving viral suppression and reducing HIV transmission. The analysis found that mental health was a significant predictor of adherence in resource-limited countries. Different psychosocial variables may predict adherence in prevention-focused ART compared to treatment-focused ART. The study had limitations, such as subjective adherence measurement methods and potential participant motivations influencing behavior. Overall, optimizing adherence through evidence-based counseling and feedback on viral suppression is crucial for successful ART outcomes.
