DNA replication requires a single-stranded DNA template for proper base pairing by DNA polymerase. DNA helicases help unwind the DNA duplex during replication by using energy from NTP hydrolysis for movement along the DNA. In bacteriophage T7, the replisome includes DNA polymerase, a processivity factor, an ssDNA-binding protein, and a DNA helicase and primase protein. The gene 4 protein in T7 combines helicase and primase activities in a single protein, with specific amino acid residues like Lys-318, Glu-343, and Arg-522 playing crucial roles in helicase function. The Arg-522 residue acts as an arginine finger, stabilizing dTTP hydrolysis transition states and triggering conformational changes for translocation on single-stranded DNA. The gene 4 protein's helicase fragment shows similarities to other NTP-hydrolyzing enzymes. Mutations in the arginine finger can impact nucleotide hydrolysis and DNA unwinding. Vi inhibits both the ssDNA-dependent dTTPase activity and DNA-unwinding activity of T7 gene 4 helicase. Substituting Arg-522 with alanine or lysine affects dTTP hydrolysis and DNA unwinding activities, with the lysine substitution retaining some coupling between dT
