ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting around 5% of children, with inattention being a core feature linked to deficits in focused attention and inhibition control. Eye movement is closely tied to attention, with children with ADHD showing atypical eye movements and deficits in visual attention. Quiet Eye (QE) training, focusing on optimizing gaze control, has shown positive effects on attention in children with developmental coordination disorder. A study investigated the effects of QE training on attention in children with ADHD, finding improvements in concentration performance and reduced errors in the d2-R Test. QE training enhanced visual attention on target cues, leading to improved concentration on details in the visual field. However, the training did not impact tonic attention, which involves endogenously controlled alertness, or phasic attention, which involves responses to external stimuli. The study also found that QE training improved catch performance and sustained eye fixations during visually directed tasks. While the study had limitations, such as including medicated children with ADHD, it suggests that QE training could be a beneficial non-pharmacological therapy for improving focused attention in children with ADHD. Further research in this area is recommended.
