The text discusses the prevalence of aortic stenosis (AS) in different income countries, with calcific AS common in developed countries and Rheumatic Heart Disease in developing nations. Heyde syndrome, linking GI bleeding and AS, is mentioned. Von Willebrand factor (VWF) is described as a key plasma glycoprotein involved in hemostasis, with ultra-large VWF multimers noted for their pro-thrombotic nature. ADAMTS-13 enzyme regulates VWF levels, affected by shear stress. A systematic review explored the association between AS and acquired von-Willebrand disease, finding evidence supporting a true relationship. Studies highlight the impact of increased shear stress from a stenotic aortic valve on VWF cleavage. AS is characterized by a narrowing aortic valve due to fibrosis and calcification, prevalent in older individuals. Heyde syndrome involves AS, GI bleeding, and acquired Von Willebrand disease. Surgery can correct acquired VWF deficiency. Mutations in VWF can lead to bleeding risks. Further research is needed to understand the impact of VWF deficiency in AS and develop prevention strategies.
