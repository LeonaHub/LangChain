Crossbreeding for heterosis has revolutionized agricultural production by creating offspring with superior qualities compared to their parents. Understanding the molecular basis of heterosis is crucial for identifying plant or animal varieties that exhibit useful heterosis when crossed. Various hypotheses, such as dominance, over-dominance, and epistasis, have been proposed to explain the mechanisms behind heterosis, emphasizing the impact of advantageous alleles, heterozygosity, and gene interactions for multigenic traits. Advancements in genome-wide methods, such as microarray and RNA-Seq, have allowed for the examination of gene expression patterns in heterosis. Studies have shown that gene expression plays a key role in phenotypic heterosis, with differential gene expression between parents and hybrids contributing significantly to understanding heterosis. The text discusses a study that analyzed gene expression in chicken embryos from different lines, identifying genes related to brain development, immune functions, and antimicrobial abilities. The study also highlighted the importance of gene expression patterns in metabolic pathways and the potential role of trans-acting regulation in heterosis. Further research is needed to fully understand the molecular mechanisms underlying heterosis in chickens and other livestock species.
