Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is a vital intervention for heart failure patients, but nonresponse rates are significant due to factors like patient selection and lead placement. Parameters like peak oxygen consumption and B-type natriuretic peptides are crucial prognostic indicators for CRT response. Personalized approaches to CRT implementation are justified by differences in LV and RV activation among heart failure patients. A study introduced a new method using three-dimensional electrical body surface mapping to assess RV and LV activation times for predicting CRT response accurately. The study involved 30 adult patients with chronic systolic heart failure and utilized various imaging techniques to evaluate ventricular function and activation timing. The study found that assessing ventricular activation separately is more closely associated with CRT response outcomes than biventricular measures. Three-dimensional body surface mapping was shown to predict positive outcomes after CRT and determine effective pacing strategies. The study highlighted the importance of improved electrical interventricular synchrony in enhancing LV function with pacing. The findings suggest that three-dimensional body surface electrical mapping could have a significant clinical impact for many patients with traditional CRT implants. Future research could expand on these findings by studying pacing modes over longer periods with larger patient samples.
