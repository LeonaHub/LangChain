The Abyssinian pea is a distinct taxon cultivated in Ethiopia and Yemen, closely related to the domesticated pea but lacking a wild form and facing fertility barriers with other pea species. It possesses unique traits like serrate leaflets and a glossy seed coat. The genetic relationship between Abyssinian pea and domesticated peas is of interest, with studies showing limited genetic diversity and divergence time of less than 10,000 years. The origin of the Abyssinian pea is debated, with hypotheses suggesting hybridization events with other pea species. Genetic analysis reveals a close relationship between Abyssinian pea and P. s. ssp. sativum, indicating a potential link to the original ancestor of cultivated peas. The study also explores the genetic diversity and relationships between different pea varieties, highlighting the challenges in capturing all genetic variations. The text discusses the genetic traits of the Abyssinian pea, focusing on indehiscent pods and seed dormancy, and suggests a potential connection to the domestication process. The lack of convincing evidence for independent domestication of the Abyssinian pea is noted, with further research needed to demonstrate separate mutations in its lineage. The text also compares the genetic diversity and potential for crop improvement between sativum and abyssinicum subspecies of Pisum sativum, highlighting the unique alleles and low genetic diversity of the Abyssinian pea. The distribution and taxonomic classification of Pisum species are discussed, with debates on species recognition and challenges in classifying related organisms within the genus. Recent research suggests a potential hybridization event between P. s. ssp. sativum and P. s. ssp. elatius for the origin of the Abyssinian pea, possibly from Asia Minor. The domestication of the Abyssinian pea remains a topic of debate, with the evolution of traits like indehiscent pods and lack of seed dormancy requiring further investigation.
