Diabetes mellitus is a growing health concern in high-income countries, with rates expected to double by 2030 due to aging populations and increasing obesity. Hyperglycemia, even without a formal diabetes diagnosis, is becoming more common and is linked to various health issues. Understanding the impact of blood glucose levels on postoperative outcomes in neurosurgery is crucial due to the increasing risk of hyperglycemia and diabetes in the general population. A study conducted at the University of Michigan Hospitals analyzed complications following spinal or craniotomy surgeries within 30 days post-operation, finding that higher preoperative blood glucose levels were associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications, longer hospital stays, and extended stays in the neurosurgical ICU. The study also revealed a dose-response relationship, where higher blood glucose levels were associated with a higher risk of complications and longer stays in the ICU and hospital. Tight glycemic control has shown to improve outcomes and reduce the risk of complications in surgical patients. High preoperative blood glucose levels may indicate poor long-term glycemic control in diabetic patients, increasing their risk of postoperative complications. Well-controlled diabetic patients are likely to have better outcomes compared to those with uncontrolled diabetes. The text emphasizes the importance of monitoring blood glucose levels in neurosurgical patients and suggests the need for further research, including randomized controlled trials, to investigate the impact of tight glycemic control on post-neurosurgical outcomes.
