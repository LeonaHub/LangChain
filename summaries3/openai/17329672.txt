The text explores the Complexity Account of Treatment Efficacy in addressing naming deficits in individuals with fluent aphasia, focusing on semantic complexity and the organization of semantic categories. It discusses the importance of atypical examples with distinctive features in treatment, proposing a complexity hierarchy based on item typicality. Various theories on semantic organization, such as the Weighted Overlappingly Organized Features model and the Organized Unitary Content Hypothesis, are discussed. The text highlights the typicality effect, where typical examples are named and verified more quickly than atypical examples, and how training with semantically complex atypical examples can lead to generalization to simpler items. It also emphasizes the role of semantic processing in treatment efficacy and the impact of selecting appropriate examples for treatment outcomes. The study suggests that considering semantic complexity, typicality, and other factors can improve lexical access and language recovery in individuals with aphasia.
