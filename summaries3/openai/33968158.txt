The text discusses the significance of lung cancer, particularly lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), as a prevalent and deadly disease globally, emphasizing the role of proteases and the PAR2 receptor in tumor metastasis and cancer progression. It highlights the impact of PAR2 promoter methylation on LUAD cell behavior, such as proliferation and invasion, and suggests PAR2 as a potential biomarker for diagnosing and predicting outcomes in LUAD patients. The study used bioinformatics analysis, qRT-PCR, Western blot, and MSP to investigate the relationship between PAR2 promoter methylation, gene expression, and cancer progression in LUAD cells. The findings indicate that hypomethylation of the PAR2 promoter leads to increased PAR2 expression, promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. The study also explored the use of a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor to modulate PAR2 expression and cell behavior in LUAD. Further research is needed to identify specific methylated sites and validate PAR2 as a therapeutic target for LUAD.
