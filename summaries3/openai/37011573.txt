Collagen is a vital protein in vertebrates, constituting about 30% of their proteins, with a triple-helical structure stabilized by hydrogen bonds. Collagen and gelatin are widely used in industries like food, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics, typically sourced from terrestrial animals. However, concerns about disease transmission and cultural restrictions have led to a focus on alternative sources like soft-shelled turtle calipash. Research has shown that mass spectrometry-based proteomics can identify specific peptide biomarkers in calipash, aiding in quality control. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) in gelatin peptides, such as hydroxylation and deamidation, offer options for identifying calipash and its products. Studies have used LC-MS and nano-LC-MS/MS analyses to identify STG-specific peptide biomarkers, with a focus on collagen-related proteins. The discovery of ST
