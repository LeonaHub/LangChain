VKORC1 is a membrane protein in the endoplasmic reticulum crucial for converting vitamin K epoxide to vitamin K, essential for blood coagulation. It is targeted by warfarin, affecting clotting factor synthesis. Genetic variations in VKORC1 impact warfarin dosage. VKORC1 has an active site facing the ER lumen, and its reductant is unknown. VKORC1L1, a paralogous protein, has a different membrane topology and reaction mechanism compared to VKORC1. Studies show VKORC1L1's role in vitamin K reduction and carboxylation, with conserved loop cysteines being essential for its function. VKORC1L1's disulfide bond formation involves an intra-molecular electron transfer pathway. VKORC1L1's structure and loop cysteines are crucial for its activity, distinct from VKORC1. VKORC1L1 may complement VKORC1 in extrahepatic tissues during anticoagulation therapy. VKORC1L1's resistance to warfarin inhibition and its physiological function are still uncertain. The text also discusses the topology and function of VKORC1L1 in mammalian cells, highlighting its role in carboxylation and active site regeneration.
