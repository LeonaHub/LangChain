Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive form of breast cancer lacking certain receptors, making it challenging to treat with poor prognosis due to rapid growth and early spread. Rho-GTPases, key molecules controlling cellular processes, are linked to various cancers, with Rho-GAPs like DLC-3 implicated in cancer cell proliferation. A study investigated DLC-3 in TNBC, finding its downregulation associated with clinicopathologic features and lymph node metastasis. Overexpressing DLC-3 inhibited proliferation, colony formation, and invasion of breast cancer cells. DLC-3 was shown to regulate the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway, impacting cell proliferation. The study suggests DLC-3 as a potential tumor suppressor in TNBC, with future research exploring its role and interactions further.
