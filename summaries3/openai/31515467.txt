A study conducted at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University between 2013 and 2018 analyzed the expression and function of the circular RNA circ_0079993 derived from the mRNA of POLR2J4 in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues and cell lines. The study involved RNA extraction, qRT-PCR analysis, transfection experiments with siRNAs and microRNAs, in vitro and in vivo assays, and dual-luciferase reporter assays to investigate the interaction between circ_0079993, miR-203a-3p.1, and CREB1. Results showed that circ_0079993 was significantly upregulated in CRC tissues and cell lines, with knockdown inhibiting CRC cell growth. The study revealed that circ_0079993 acted as a sponge for miR-203a-3p.1, indirectly regulating CREB1 expression and affecting CRC cell proliferation. The research highlighted the potential of circ_0079993 as a diagnostic and therapeutic biomarker in CRC and emphasized the need for further studies to understand the complex regulatory networks involving circRNAs in CRC pathogenesis.
