The text discusses the global impact of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which led to the COVID-19 pandemic with over 500 million confirmed cases reported. It highlights the importance of developing mucosal vaccines to induce local immune responses in the respiratory tract, preventing viral replication and shedding. The text emphasizes the role of mucosal immunity in responding to SARS-CoV-2 infection, focusing on inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and the formation of inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT) in the airways. It delves into the BAFF/APRIL system's role in B cell development, antibody production, and immune regulation, particularly in respiratory viral infections like COVID-19. The text also explores the significance of homeostatic chemokines like CXCL13, CCL19, and CCL21 in initiating local B cell responses post-infection. It discusses the potential benefits of inducing iBALT formation through mucosal vaccines to enhance immune responses against various infections, including SARS-CoV-2. The text suggests utilizing BAFF/APRIL or CXCL13 in combination with spike protein-encoding mRNA as adjuvants in mucosal vaccines to boost local mucosal immune responses against SARS-CoV-2.
