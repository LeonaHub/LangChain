Aortic intramural hematomas (AIH) are now considered thrombosed aortic dissections, primarily affecting older females with cardiovascular risk factors, often involving the descending aorta. Symptoms are non-specific, and elevated D-dimer levels may indicate extension of the condition. CT is the preferred diagnostic tool, providing important prognostic information. MRI techniques are also used but have limitations. Management may involve medical therapy or thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) for serious complications. TEVAR is used to treat acute aortic dissections by excluding the false lumen and promoting thrombosis, with careful risk assessment needed. The text discusses a case of AIH type B treated with TEVAR, which initially succeeded but later led to complications requiring open surgery. The importance of careful evaluation and monitoring in aortic surgery, including consideration of graft size, is emphasized. TEVAR is effective but can lead to complications like aortic dissection. The text advises against preemptive TEVAR in uncomplicated cases of AIH. Close follow-up is crucial due to potential serious complications. Informed consent was obtained for publishing the case report, emphasizing the importance of recognizing symptoms and using imaging techniques for diagnosis and monitoring. Treatment decisions should be made after evaluating risks and benefits.
