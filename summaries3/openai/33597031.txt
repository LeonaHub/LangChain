Endoscopic nasopharyngectomy is increasingly preferred for treating local, recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (rNPC) due to improved visualization and instrumentation, offering favorable early survival outcomes. Studies have shown promising 2-year overall survival rates, with limited data on 5-year outcomes. A study from North America reported an 84.6% 5-year overall survival rate for patients undergoing this procedure. The text discusses the surgical approach, post-operative surveillance, and outcomes of patients with rNPC who underwent endoscopic nasopharyngectomy, highlighting the importance of close monitoring and prompt treatment for recurrent cases. Patients with lower stages of recurrence had higher disease-free rates and better overall prognosis. The study also addresses the challenges of managing treatment-resistant tumors and the need for further research to compare the benefits of endoscopic nasopharyngectomy to other treatment modalities.
