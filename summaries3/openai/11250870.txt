The text discusses the control of peripheral arterial tone by the sympathetic nervous system through the co-release of ATP and noradrenaline, which act on arterial P2X receptors and Î±-adrenoceptors to mediate vasoconstriction. The relative contribution of each transmitter can vary based on factors such as vessel size, species, and stimulation parameters. Small arteries and arterioles play a crucial role in determining vascular resistance and systemic blood pressure, with most research focusing on medium and large arteries. Studies have shown that P2X receptors play a significant role in small and medium arteries during high-frequency sympathetic nerve activity, while large arteries primarily respond through adrenergic pathways. The text also discusses the role of calcium in triggering smooth muscle contraction through noradrenaline and P2X receptors, with uncertainties surrounding calcium sources and signal amplification in P2X receptor activation. Studies have investigated the impact of L-type calcium channel antagonists on nerve-evoked contractions, suggesting that calcium influx in response to P2X receptor activation is primarily through the P2X receptor channel itself. Additionally, the text describes experimental procedures and methodologies used to study neurogenic vasoconstriction in different sizes of rat mesenteric arteries, highlighting the importance of stimulation parameters in influencing contractile responses. The study findings suggest that P2X receptors could be potential targets for hypertension treatment, particularly in small arteries where the purinergic component dominates in regulating arterial tone.
