The text discusses the importance of using suitable animal models, such as the Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat, to study diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetes. The GK rat is a model of genetic nonobese type 2 diabetes mellitus that exhibits mild hyperglycemia and early structural changes similar to human diabetic nephropathy. A study conducted on GK rats revealed that prolonged hyperglycemia led to morphological changes in the kidneys, including glomerulosclerosis, mesangial cell proliferation, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. The study also observed increased expression of Î±-SMA and type IV collagen, as well as macrophage infiltration, indicating renal damage progression. Comparisons with age-matched Wistar rats showed that GK rats displayed kidney features resembling human diabetic nephropathy, suggesting that prolonged hyperglycemia plays a significant role in inducing this condition in type 2 diabetes. The study highlights the importance of understanding the impact of prolonged hyperglycemia and aging on renal complications in diabetes.
