Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a significant global public health issue, leading to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Over 700,000 deaths are linked to AMR annually, highlighting the seriousness of the problem. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria, a result of the overuse or misuse of antibiotics, are a growing concern globally. In the European Union, it is projected that over 33,000 deaths will be caused by these bacteria by 2050. Multidrug resistance is a significant challenge in treating infections, leading to the use of reserve antibiotics with higher costs and decreased safety profiles. Among the most impactful multidrug-resistant germs are the ESKAPE pathogens, which can evade the effects of antibiotics and include Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. The text discusses the challenges faced by laboratories in microbiological diagnosis and changes in antibiotic sensitivity testing standards, which limit the analysis of hospital data over multiple years. Despite observing increasing trends in MRSA, ESBL, and MDR rates, the resistance profile for ESKAPE germs in an infectious diseases hospital did not show significant statistical annual variations during the analyzed timeframe. Efforts to enhance superbug surveillance in infectious diseases hospitals should focus on improving identification methods, adopting EUCAST standards, increasing clinical vigilance for infectious diagnosis, and promoting justified use of antibiotics. Recognizing AMR is crucial for updating local antibiotic prescription protocols, and streamlining microbiological diagnosis and aligning with European antimicrobial susceptibility testing are key steps in harmonizing regional networks for effective AMR control practices.
