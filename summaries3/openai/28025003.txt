Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes into oxylipin metabolites, such as hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which play crucial roles in various diseases. The text explores the conversion of omega-3 PUFAs like eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) into bioactive compounds and compares their biological effects to those of arachidonic acid (ARA)-derived metabolites like 20-HETE. While 20-HETE has been associated with negative effects in diseases, EPA and DHA metabolites have shown beneficial effects, including pain reduction and blood pressure regulation. The text discusses the chemical synthesis of these compounds, highlighting challenges and methods involved. It also delves into the biological evaluation of these ω-hydroxy PUFAs, particularly focusing on their effects on pain perception and TRPV1 activation. The study demonstrates that 20-HETE induces pain, while EPA and DHA-derived metabolites like 20-HEPE and 22-HDoHE do not, suggesting potential therapeutic properties for these compounds in TRPV1 activation without causing pain. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms and therapeutic potential of these ω-hydroxy PUFAs.
