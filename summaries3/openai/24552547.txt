The text discusses the influence of endogenous hormones and environmental chemicals, specifically the plasticizer BPA and soy phytochemical genistein, on breast cancer risk. BPA exposure has been linked to increased cell proliferation and mammary gland changes in animals, potentially leading to carcinogenesis. In contrast, genistein has shown inhibitory effects on breast cancer cell proliferation and signaling pathways. Studies in rats have demonstrated the impact of BPA and genistein exposure on mammary gland development and susceptibility to tumors. The text details a study using TMT-MS to analyze serum proteome changes in rats exposed to BPA and genistein, identifying differentially expressed proteins associated with carcinogenesis and chemoprevention. The study found reversible and lasting effects on protein expression, highlighting potential biomarkers of susceptibility to these chemicals. Western blot analysis validated changes in protein expression, emphasizing the importance of identifying molecular targets for understanding the mechanisms of action of BPA and genistein in breast cancer development and prevention. The study underscores the significance of studying the serum proteome in rat models to provide insights for future research in human populations at risk for breast cancer.
