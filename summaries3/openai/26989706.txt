The text discusses the increasing prevalence of asthma and allergies in industrialized countries, attributing it to factors beyond genetic changes. It highlights the link between respiratory infections and asthma, emphasizing the importance of understanding the immune system's response to respiratory pathogens, particularly Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). The study investigated sTLR2 levels in asthmatics and healthy individuals, finding lower levels in asthmatics in both serum and sputum samples. Additionally, TLR2 mRNA expression was lower in asthmatics compared to healthy subjects. The down-regulation of TLR2 expression in asthmatic lungs may be influenced by cytokines like IL-1, TNF-Î±, and IL-6. The text suggests that sTLR2 could potentially serve as a marker for asthma severity, but further research is needed to understand the relationship between sTLR2 levels and asthma severity.
