Efforts to address medical student mistreatment have been ongoing, with the University of Vermont Larner College of Medicine developing a film and curriculum to convey learners' perspectives on mistreatment. The curriculum aims to reduce defensiveness and promote mutual empathy to create a culture of respect in medicine. The film and curriculum were designed to expose learners to the perspectives of educators and encourage behavior change in the learning environment. The curriculum was found to be effective in sparking discussions and increasing understanding between students and faculty. However, questions remain about the long-term impact and whether it has led to lasting behavioral change. The text emphasizes the importance of including resident and medical student contributions in curriculum development to optimize participation and provide a well-rounded perspective. While the curriculum has been positively received, there are concerns about oversimplifying student mistreatment issues and the need to address gaps in perspectives, such as input from patients and families. Overall, promoting dialogue through realistic portrayals of mistreatment is seen as a way to foster understanding and empathy among different groups in the medical learning environment.
