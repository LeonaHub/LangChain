The text discusses the importance of maize as a cereal plant and the role of sucrose in carbohydrate transport. It explores the allocation of resources in maize plants from source to sink organs, influenced by internal and external factors. Acid invertases in maize, such as Zm-INCW2 and Zm-IVR2, are crucial for sucrose partitioning and cell division. The discovery of a protein inhibitor, Zm-INVINH4, in maize is highlighted, showing its role in regulating invertase activity, particularly under drought stress. The study delves into the molecular characteristics, expression patterns, and inhibitory function of Zm-INVINH4, suggesting its involvement in maize growth and development under stress conditions. The research involves genetic cloning, protein expression, and functional assays to investigate the impact of Zm-INVINH4 on invertase-related processes. The study aims to enhance productivity and resilience to drought-induced seed abortion in maize. Various experiments, including gene expression analysis, protein purification, and inhibition assays, were conducted to elucidate the role of Zm-INVINH4 in maize plants. The text provides detailed methodologies and statistical analyses used in the research, emphasizing the significance of Zm-INVINH4 as an inhibitor of invertase activity in maize under drought stress.
