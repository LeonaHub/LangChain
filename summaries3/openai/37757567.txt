Cardiac arrest is a leading cause of global mortality, often presenting with ventricular fibrillation. Survival rates decline rapidly post-arrest, underscoring the critical role of prompt, high-quality CPR and defibrillation. Monitoring the heart's electrical activities through electrocardiographic signals is crucial in managing cardiac arrest. Photoplethysmography (PPG) reflects mechanical activities and can be easily obtained using a pulse oximeter. Traditional studies have focused on electrical and mechanical activities separately, but combining ECG and PPG signals simultaneously during CPR may offer deeper insights into cardiac function. Cross Recurrence Quantification Analysis (CRQA) is a novel method that studies the coupling of electrical and mechanical systems during CPR. An experiment on pigs analyzed ECG and PPG signals using CRQA across different stages of cardiac function. Results showed distinct patterns in dynamical structures of ECG and PPG signals during various periods, providing insights into cardiovascular function evolution during CPR. Parameters like Recurrence Rate (RR), Determinism (DET), Entropy (ENTR), and Trapping Time (TT) were used to quantify the dynamics of ECG and PPG signals. The study found significant differences in these parameters across different periods, with CPR showing improved dynamics compared to cardiac arrest. The study also highlighted the potential of ECG and PPG signals as non-invasive indicators for monitoring CPR progress and prognosis. The study suggests that analyzing electrical-mechanical coupling could be valuable in emergency treatment settings, although further research involving human subjects is needed to translate these findings into clinical practice.
