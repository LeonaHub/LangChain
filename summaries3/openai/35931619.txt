Wound healing involves three phases: hemostasis, granulation tissue refurbishment, and epithelialization. Factors like hypoxia and bacterial infections can influence the healing process. Monitoring wounds systematically is crucial for proper healing, focusing on factors like wound bed tissues, perilesional skin, clinical characteristics, comorbidities, and metabolic activity. Various measurement instruments are used to assess wound severity and healing processes, including the RESVECH 2.0 tool, which was developed and validated in a Portuguese version. The study involved patients with chronic wounds in an oncology hospital and assessed reliability and validity through agreement between raters, internal consistency, content, construct, and criterion validity. The RESVECH 2.0 scale demonstrated good internal consistency and reliability, aligning with previous research on wound healing and quality of life. The study found that body mass index significantly influenced the RESVECH 2.0 scale score, indicating its impact on wound healing. The study concluded that individuals with chronic wounds, especially those with odor and exposed locations, experienced significant psychological suffering leading to a loss of quality of life and well-being. The European Portuguese version of RESVECH 2.0 showed good validity and internal consistency for use in research and clinical practice, providing valuable outcome indicators for evaluating health interventions in treating chronic wounds. Further research is needed to assess its psychometric properties in different settings.
