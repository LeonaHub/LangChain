The text discusses the use of oral anticoagulant therapy for preventing stroke and embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation, focusing on two main types: indirect oral anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin) and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). DOACs have advantages over traditional VKAs, but may have a higher risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. The text describes a study in Italy's Campania region analyzing preventable bleeding cases associated with oral anticoagulant use. It details the methodology, including the classification of Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) and the P-method for preventability assessment. The study found that a significant number of reported adverse reactions involved indirect oral anticoagulants, with various risk factors identified. The text also discusses critical criteria related to healthcare professionals' practices, drug-drug interactions, and inappropriate prescriptions. It highlights the importance of identifying preventable adverse drug reactions to improve patient safety and clinical practice. The study aims to promote appropriate use of oral anticoagulants and enhance pharmacovigilance activities in the region.
