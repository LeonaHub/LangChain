Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a deadly cancer often diagnosed at advanced stages with poor survival rates even after surgical treatment. Identifying biomarkers like BORIS and SOCS3 is crucial for improving HCC diagnosis, prognosis, and targeted therapy. BORIS, a DNA-binding protein, is associated with various cancers, including HCC, and its high expression is linked to poor prognosis. SOCS3, a JAK/STAT signaling pathway inhibitor, is frequently hypermethylated in cancers, including HCC, and its low expression may promote cell growth and migration. A study at West China Hospital identified BORIS and SOCS3 as potential prognostic biomarkers for HCC patients. High BORIS expression and low SOCS3 expression were associated with poor survival outcomes, while the opposite was linked to better prognostic outcomes. The study found a negative correlation between BORIS and SOCS3 in HCC, suggesting a potential therapeutic target in BORIS for HCC treatment. High BORIS levels and low SOCS3 levels are associated with tumor recurrence and poor clinical outcomes in HCC patients, and combining their expression levels improves predictive sensitivity. Further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms fully.
