Diabetes mellitus is a significant global health issue with projections indicating a rise in cases by 2035, leading to a heightened risk of heart failure for individuals with diabetes. Diabetic cardiomyopathy, a complication of diabetes, involves cardiac structural and functional abnormalities, with the exact cause remaining unknown. Chronic hyperglycemia in diabetes contributes to cardiac injury by promoting oxidative stress and cardiomyocyte apoptosis, leading to left ventricular remodeling. Curcumin, a compound derived from turmeric, has antioxidant properties that protect the heart by enhancing antioxidant defenses and reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Studies have shown that curcumin can protect against high glucose-induced cardiac damage by inhibiting apoptosis and reducing ROS production. Curcumin also activates the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3Î² signaling pathway, which inhibits apoptosis induced by high glucose levels. The study investigated the effects of curcumin on high glucose-induced cardiomyocyte injury, demonstrating increased cell viability, reduced tissue damage markers, and decreased apoptosis in cardiomyocytes exposed to high glucose when treated with curcumin. Curcumin was found to modulate apoptotic-related proteins, decrease ROS generation, and enhance antioxidant activity in cardiomyocytes exposed to high glucose, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent for diabetic cardiomyopathy.
