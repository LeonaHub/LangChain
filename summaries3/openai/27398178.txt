Pulp capping is a dental procedure that involves treating exposed vital pulp by applying capping materials to stimulate dentin formation. Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) is a commonly recommended capping material due to its versatility and effectiveness. Researchers have been studying the similarities between MTA and Portland cement to find a cost-effective alternative. Studies have shown that Portland cement and MTA have similar compositions and antimicrobial properties, with Portland cement even outperforming MTA in some cases. However, Portland cement lacks bismuth oxide, a radiopacifier found in MTA. Despite the drawbacks of calcium hydroxide, it has been considered the gold standard in dental materials. A study aimed to develop a new pulp capping material by combining Portland cement with bismuth oxide and calcium hydroxide. The resulting cements, named Portland Cal I and Portland Cal II, were tested for various properties. The study compared setting times, compressive strength, diametral tensile strength, and push-out bond strength of different materials. MTA showed the shortest setting times and highest compressive strength, while Portland cement with bismuth oxide had the highest push-out bond strength. The study recommended adding 10 wt% calcium hydroxide to Portland cement to create a new pulp capping material with acceptable physical and adhesive properties.
