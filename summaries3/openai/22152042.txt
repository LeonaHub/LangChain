Silver nanoparticles (SNPs) are widely used in civil, therapeutic, and industrial applications and can be synthesized through physical, chemical, or biological methods, with biosynthesis being preferred for its environmental safety and cost-effectiveness. Biologically synthesized SNPs have applications in therapeutics, drug delivery, anticancer treatments, and bio-imaging. Nature produces various nanomaterials biologically, and recent research focuses on controlling the size and shape of nanoparticles. The biosynthesis of SNPs involves trapping Ag+ ions and reducing them with enzymes, although the exact mechanisms are not fully understood. Studies have identified proteins involved in biosynthesis and capping of SNPs, with research highlighting the role of oxidoreductive machinery in synthesis and stabilization. The size and distribution of SNPs vary in vitro and in vivo, with proteins playing a significant role in biosynthesis. Various cellular proteins, such as histone (H4), carbonic anhydrase, and superoxide dismutase, are associated with SNPs biosynthesis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of biosynthesis is crucial for regulating the size and shape of SNPs. The study emphasizes the importance of controlled synthesis of environmentally friendly nanoparticles with desired characteristics. The involvement of specific proteins in controlling nanoparticle size and shape needs further investigation for commercial production. The text discusses the biosynthesis of SNPs by C. reinhardtii, highlighting the role of cellular proteins in nanoparticle synthesis and capping. Techniques such as mass spectrometry and transmission electron microscopy are used to identify proteins associated with SNPs biosynthesis. The study reveals differences in protein band patterns between pre-synthesized and biosynthesized SNPs, emphasizing the influence of cellular proteins on nanoparticle characteristics. The research aims to understand the molecular machinery and oxidoreductive proteins involved in SNPs biosynthesis, providing insights into the regulation of nanoparticle size and shape.
