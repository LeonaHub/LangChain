The male reproductive tract consists of various structures like the testis, excurrent ductules, and accessory glands such as the prostate and seminal vesicle. The epididymis, a part of the excurrent ductules, is a complex structure with different cell types localized in specific regions along the ductules. These cells play distinct roles in regulating epididymal functions, including sperm maturation, storage, and protection. The movement of water in and out of the epididymis is crucial for creating an optimal environment for sperm maturation, with aquaporins (AQPs) facilitating water transport across cell membranes. The expression and localization of AQPs, specifically AQP1 and AQP9, in the male reproductive tract are influenced by factors like androgen and estrogen. Nandrolone decanoate (ND), a steroidal compound, can impact male fertility and alter AQP expression in the epididymis. A study investigated the effects of different doses and durations of ND treatment on Aqp1 and Aqp9 expression in various segments of the rat epididymis. Results showed segment-specific and dose-dependent changes in Aqp1 and Aqp9 expression in response to ND treatment. The study suggests that the differential regulation of AQPs by ND may be influenced by varying concentrations of the androgen receptor along the epididymis. Further research is needed to fully understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of ND on Aqp1 and Aqp9 expression and their potential implications for male fertility.
