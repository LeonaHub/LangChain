The text discusses the increasing prevalence of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in the United States and the potential rise in cases by 2050 due to various factors like improving economics, obesity, and longer life expectancy. It highlights the well-documented vascular complications post-TKA, particularly venous thromboembolism (VTE), and the impact of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) on TKA outcomes. The text describes a study that analyzed data on TKA patients with varying levels of CVI complexity, finding that complex CVI may lead to more complications compared to simple CVI. The study also examines the associations between different factors and the risks of complications in TKA patients, emphasizing the importance of preoperative diagnoses like CVI in managing postoperative complications. Overall, the text underscores the need for further research to understand the impact of CVI on TKA outcomes and highlights improvements in patient care and TKA outcomes over recent years.
