Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has shown potential benefits in improving motor and cognitive function recovery in animal models of traumatic brain injury and has been used to treat conditions like epilepsy, depression, and chronic pain. VNS has been approved by the FDA for drug-resistant epilepsy and depression. VNS may also be beneficial in addressing maladaptive neuronal plasticity disorders like tinnitus. Studies have explored the use of VNS paired with specific tones or notched music to treat tinnitus, with varying success rates reported in patients. Transcutaneous VNS (tVNS) is being explored as a less invasive alternative to implanted electrodes for VNS, showing promise in treating chronic tinnitus. Studies have found improvements in subjective tinnitus loudness and awareness scores with tVNS paired with notched music therapy, although complete remission of tinnitus was not achieved. The effectiveness of neuromodulation treatments for tinnitus may vary between human subjects and animal models, with factors like treatment onset, device type, and intensity influencing outcomes. Further research is needed to optimize tVNS parameters and confirm the long-term efficacy of this therapeutic approach.
