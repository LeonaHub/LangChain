The text discusses the use of intravenous dipyridamole during exercise in combination with technetium-99m methoxy isobutyl isonitrile (99mTc-MIBI) myocardial single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to improve diagnostic accuracy for patients with inadequate physical performance during stress testing. A study involving 231 patients evaluated the effectiveness of this combined approach compared to exercise testing alone. The study found that adding dipyridamole during exercise improved the quality of myocardial perfusion images and diagnostic accuracy, particularly in patients with inadequate exercise test results. The text also highlights the importance of withdrawing beta-blockers before diagnostic testing to enhance accuracy. The simultaneous administration of dipyridamole and exercise was shown to increase sensitivity and negative predictive value, leading to improved diagnostic yield without losing important prognostic data from maximal subjective exercise tests. The combined protocol was found to enhance the effects of exercise, minimize secondary effects of dipyridamole, and provide a safe option for most patients undergoing myocardial SPECT imaging.
