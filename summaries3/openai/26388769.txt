Aging affects neuronal properties, leading to decreased excitability and synaptic function, resulting in sensory, motor deficits, and memory loss. Studies on Aplysia snails have shown a decline in excitability with age, particularly in response to L-glutamate. The Tail Withdrawal Reflex (TWR) in Aplysia involves identified sensory neurons and motoneurons, with different forms of nonassociative learning induced in TWR, such as sensitization. Serotonin plays a crucial role in synaptic facilitation, activating protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathways. Studies on aging in Aplysia have shown changes in tail sensory neuron excitability, with a study focusing on the effects of serotonin on excitability in aging. The study found that activators of PKA and PKC signaling pathways could partially restore excitability in aged sensory neurons. Additionally, studies have shown that
