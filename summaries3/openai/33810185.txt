Barley grain is rich in bioactive compounds like dietary fiber, β-glucans, arabinoxylans, phenolic compounds, tocols, sterols, and folates, which have various health benefits. These compounds accumulate during the grain filling phase and play a crucial role in determining the final weight, nutrient composition, and quality of the grain. The accumulation patterns of these bioactive compounds, particularly β-glucans, arabinoxylans, and phenolic compounds, are influenced by factors like genotype, environment, and heat stress. Studies have shown that high temperatures during grain filling can impact grain weight and alter the composition of bioactive compounds in barley grains. Genotypic differences play a significant role in determining the content of these compounds, with some genotypes showing higher concentrations under heat stress. The study also highlights the impact of heat stress on antioxidant capacity and phenolic content in barley grains, with some genotypes exhibiting increased antioxidant capacity under stress conditions. The research emphasizes the importance of understanding the dynamics of bioactive compounds during grain filling to enhance the nutritional quality of barley grains. Further studies are needed to explore the effects of climate change on barley production and the structure of bioactive compounds in grains, which can ultimately influence product quality.
