Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a prevalent health issue among older adults, with around 20% of elderly individuals estimated to have T2DM globally. Fragility fractures, such as hip, vertebral, and non-vertebral fractures, are a significant concern in this population, leading to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Recent evidence suggests that individuals with T2DM are at a higher risk of fragility fractures compared to non-diabetic individuals. A systematic review focused on the association between T2DM and fragility fractures in individuals over 60 years old found a strong correlation between T2DM and an increased risk of fragility fractures, particularly hip fractures. However, there is some controversy regarding non-vertebral fractures. Various factors contribute to the increased fracture risk in T2DM patients, including the disease's impact on bones, complications of T2DM, and adverse effects of its pharmacological treatment. The text also discusses the impact of factors like hyperglycemia, advanced glycosylation end products, inflammatory cytokines, and reduced incretin effect on bone health in T2DM patients. Additionally, it highlights the importance of considering specific fracture risk factors associated with T2DM in clinical practice and the potential effects of anti-diabetic drugs on bone health. Further research and monitoring of elderly patients with T2DM are recommended to better understand and address the increased risk of fragility fractures in this population.
