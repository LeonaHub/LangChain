Buffaloes are recognized globally for their productivity and heat stress resistance, with significant populations in countries like Cuba, Brazil, and Argentina. Incorporating leguminous trees like Leucaena leucocephala and Albizia lebbeck into pastures through silvopastoral systems can enhance feed quality for ruminants and improve production systems. These trees provide high-quality nutrition, with Leucaena trees known for their high rumen by-pass protein supply. Studies have shown that silvopastoral systems can increase buffalo productivity by improving weight gain and milk production. Research has also highlighted the importance of understanding buffalo preferences for different tree leaves to optimize feed intake and production. A study in Cuba assessed the selectivity of water buffaloes for various tree species, finding preferences for A. lebbeck and L. leucocephala leaves. The chemical composition of tree leaves varied, impacting factors like crude protein intake and gross energy consumption. Factors influencing consumption include feeding memory, nutrient satiety levels, and the impact of anti-nutritional components. Further research is recommended to explore the effects of secondary metabolites on feed intake and to optimize tree species selection for buffalo production systems in tropical regions.
