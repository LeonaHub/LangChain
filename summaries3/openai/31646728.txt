Patient and Family Advisory Councils (PFACs) are groups of patients, family members, and caregivers that provide input and advice in healthcare settings, aligning with the global movement towards patient involvement in healthcare planning. In the United States, PFACs are increasingly prevalent due to regulatory requirements like those in Medicare's Comprehensive Primary Care Plus program. While toolkits are available to establish PFACs, their potential impact is not fully realized, with a lack of rigorous evaluation and evidence of effectiveness. Research is needed to ensure PFACs drive patient- and family-centered improvements in healthcare settings. A study conducted within the Johns Hopkins Medicine Alliance for Patients (JMAP) aimed to understand non-PFAC members' expectations regarding PFACs to achieve outcomes such as patient satisfaction and trust in healthcare systems. The study gathered diverse perspectives on healthcare through focus groups, emphasizing the importance of involving a broader patient population in PFACs to improve patient-centered care delivery. Participants highlighted the need for better communication, transparency, and diversity within PFACs to effectively represent patients and address their concerns. The study also discussed practical recommendations for improving PFAC operations, such as increasing awareness among non-members, ensuring diversity in membership, and evaluating effectiveness. Challenges in implementing PFAC improvements include limited resources and potential conflicts between transparency and confidentiality. The study's limitations include a small sample size and geographic focus, but it provided insights on an idealized version of PFACs. Future research is recommended to gather perspectives from patients familiar with PFACs and compare findings to enhance patient-centered care and trust in healthcare systems.
