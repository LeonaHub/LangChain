The text discusses multiple studies on patients with dominantly inherited retinitis pigmentosa caused by rhodopsin mutations. These studies analyze disease severity, progression rates, and ocular function changes in patients with different mutations affecting various regions of the rhodopsin molecule. The research highlights the importance of longitudinal data in accurately assessing disease progression and emphasizes the impact of early disease expression on long-term severity. Statistical analyses, including linear regression and multiple linear regression, were used to compare rates of change in visual acuity, visual field area, and ERG amplitude among patients with different mutations. The studies also address biases in data analysis, such as ascertainment biases, and discuss the challenges of estimating disease progression from cross-sectional data. The findings suggest that disease severity in patients with rhodopsin mutations varies based on the location of the mutant amino acid residue within the opsin molecule, with mutations in the C terminus region associated with faster disease progression. The text also mentions the importance of considering other factors like modifier genes, diet, health, or light exposure that may influence disease progression. The studies were supported by grants and conducted in accordance with ethical guidelines, with the corresponding author being Eliot L. Berson.
