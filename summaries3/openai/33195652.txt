Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) is a rare fibroblastic mesenchymal neoplasm that typically affects spindle cell soft tissues and is usually benign, with rare cases of metastasis. It commonly occurs in the pleura and thorax but can affect other parts of the body, with central nervous system (CNS) involvement being uncommon. Malignant intracranial SFT is extremely rare, and the exact origin of CNS SFT is debated. The text describes a case of an 81-year-old man with intracranial malignant SFT that metastasized to the chest wall, leading to his passing despite palliative care. The discussion includes statistics on SFT demographics and characteristics, emphasizing the importance of monitoring and follow-up due to the variable behavior of SFT. The text also covers diagnostic markers, treatment options, and the challenges in predicting SFT behavior and determining malignancy. Metastases of SFT can occur in various locations, with a risk of relapse and distant metastasis even years after treatment. Long-term monitoring is crucial for patients with malignant SFT. The text underscores the significance of thorough examinations and investigations for accurate diagnosis and management of SFT cases.
