The text discusses the concept of "double diabetes," where individuals with type 1 diabetes exhibit features of type 2 diabetes, leading to the coexistence of both conditions. It highlights the importance of C-peptide levels as an indicator of residual insulin secretion and its positive effects on metabolic control. The text explores the phenomenon of partial remission in type 1 diabetes patients and factors influencing it, such as β-cell recovery and immune tolerance. It also delves into the impact of obesity on β-cell function and insulin resistance in type 1 diabetes, emphasizing the negative effects of high BMI on pancreatic beta cells. Studies have shown correlations between BMI, inflammatory cytokines, and C-peptide levels in children with type 1 diabetes. The text discusses various studies analyzing the relationship between BMI, inflammatory cytokines, and residual beta-cell function, suggesting the need for further research in this area. Additionally, it mentions therapeutic interventions targeting the immune system to preserve beta-cell function in type 1 diabetes patients. The text also highlights the importance of maintaining a healthy BMI to improve outcomes in children with type 1 diabetes.
