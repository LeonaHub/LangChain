Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal lung disease with an unpredictable course, making early diagnosis crucial for effective treatment. Forced vital capacity (FVC) is a key indicator of disease progression and mortality in IPF, with a 10% decline associated with increased mortality risk. However, FVC may not be sensitive enough to detect small changes in fibrosis progression. Functional respiratory imaging (FRI) using HRCT scans and computational fluid dynamics can provide a detailed assessment of lung health, potentially improving disease monitoring and treatment response in respiratory conditions. Studies have shown that FRI parameters can predict FVC decline in IPF patients, with lower lobe volumes, fibrotic tissue, and airway radius being key factors in disease progression. Traction bronchiectasis, detected by FRI, is associated with poor outcomes in IPF patients. FRI can capture regional lung changes not detected by traditional tests, offering valuable insights for disease characterization and treatment monitoring. Prospective validation of FRI in IPF is needed to effectively stratify patients in clinical trials and predict outcomes.
