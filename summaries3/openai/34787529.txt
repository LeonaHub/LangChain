Bacterial meningitis in neonates is a serious condition with high mortality rates and long-term complications. Diagnosing neonatal bacterial meningitis can be challenging due to high false-negative rates in cerebrospinal fluid cultures and non-specific symptoms. Early diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. A study analyzed clinical data, laboratory results, and CNS imaging of neonates with NBM to determine factors influencing positive CSF culture results. The study found that positive CSF culture neonates had higher levels of inflammatory markers and more neurological symptoms, leading to longer hospital stays and more imaging abnormalities. High CSF protein levels were associated with poorer outcomes in neonates with NBM. Identifying risk factors for positive CSF cultures can help in early aggressive therapy to prevent neurologic damage. Escherichia coli and Group B streptococcus were common pathogens in neonatal bacterial meningitis. Overuse of antimicrobial drugs in China can lead to false-negative results in CSF cultures. Further research is needed to confirm the correlation between antibiotic use before admission and CSF culture positivity rates.
