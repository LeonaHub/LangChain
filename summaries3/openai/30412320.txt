The text discusses the challenges dentists face with crown remakes due to laboratory errors, leading to time-consuming and costly processes. Factors influencing remake rates include dentist characteristics, techniques used, and clinical acceptability criteria. Studies have examined crown success factors like marginal adaptation and material longevity but lack information on remake rates. A study analyzed crown remake rates among National Dental Practice-Based Research Network clinicians, finding a 3.8% remake rate. Factors like dentist experience, practice busyness, and patient demographics were linked to crown fit and remake rates. The study highlighted variations in crown success and the need for further research in understanding clinician decision-making. Patient populations receiving crowns were noted to have higher education levels and income, with most having dental insurance. The text also discusses reasons for crown rejections, such as laboratory errors and clinician preferences, and the impact of experience on crown fit. Limitations of the study include subjective evaluations and potential bias in clinician assessments. The study design accounted for clustering among network dentists but acknowledged differences between network and non-network dentists.
