The text discusses the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, originating in Wuhan, China, and spreading to almost 200 countries, resulting in over 4.9 million deaths by October 2021. Thailand detected its first case outside of China and has reported over 1 million confirmed cases and 113,000 deaths. Efforts to control the disease in Thailand emphasize the importance of behavioral change, particularly the 3M approach: hand washing, wearing masks, and physical distancing. A study in Thailand identified factors influencing COVID-19 preventive behaviors, with social support being the most influential. Age, flu-like symptoms, gender, perceived risk of exposure, lockdown policy, and residential area also played a role. The study found that these factors explained 10.6% of the variation in preventive behaviors. The text suggests further research to explore effective communication strategies and messages to encourage preventive behaviors, especially among different age groups and genders. It also highlights the impact of lockdown policies and residential areas on preventive behaviors, with rural residents showing lower adherence compared to urban residents. Education level was not significantly associated with preventive behaviors, but promoting health literacy and access to information is recommended. The study serves as a foundation for future research to develop strategies for reducing the spread of COVID-19 in diverse populations.
