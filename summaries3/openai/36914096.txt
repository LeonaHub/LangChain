Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major global cause of death, with prevention strategies evolving to focus on long-term risk assessment and lifestyle changes. Recent guidelines recommend incorporating lifetime risk (LTR) assessment to provide a more comprehensive view of CVD risk. A study in Iran examined the LTR of CVD and the impact of risk factors like obesity, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and hypercholesterolemia. The study found that men generally had a higher LTR of CVD compared to women, with multiple risk factors increasing the likelihood of developing CVD. Maintaining optimal risk factors, especially at a young age, was associated with delayed onset of CVD. The study highlights the importance of primordial prevention and lifestyle changes in reducing long-term CVD risk, particularly in women. The text also discusses the limitations of using traditional risk assessment methods and the benefits of long-term risk assessment in motivating healthier lifestyles.
