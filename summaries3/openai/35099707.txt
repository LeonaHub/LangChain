Iron-based nanoparticles are widely used in various fields, including medical industries, due to their unique properties. These nanoparticles can impact cell growth and viability, particularly in biofilm formation. Exposure to iron nanoparticles can decrease biofilm formation in microalgae by attaching to cell surfaces. Iron nanoparticles have been observed to affect various types of bacterial cells and aquatic micro-organisms. The text discusses a study using Chlorella vulgaris as a model to investigate the impact of lysine-coated iron oxide nanoparticles on microalgal biofilm formation. The synthesis and characterization of these nanoparticles were described, along with the experimental methods used to evaluate their effects on cell growth and biofilm formation. The study found that low concentrations of lysine-coated iron oxide nanoparticles can promote cell growth and biofilm formation, while high concentrations can have toxic effects. The research highlights the concentration- and exposure time-dependent effects of iron nanoparticles on biofilm formation and cell growth in microalgae.
