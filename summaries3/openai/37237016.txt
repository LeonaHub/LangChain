The text discusses the magneto-strain effect in CrGeTe3, a 2D ferromagnetic van der Waals material with applications in spintronics and straintronics. The material exhibits semiconductor behavior with a Curie temperature of approximately 63 K and intrinsic gap tunability. The ferromagnetic ordering in CrGeTe3 influences the electronic structure, reducing the band gap and leading to a slater insulator behavior. The magneto-strain effects in the system are linked to an isostructural transition across TC, involving substantial volume collapse and a first-order nature. The electronic structure in the ferromagnetic phase shows band shifts away from the Fermi level, band broadening, and twinned bands. The magneto-strain effects are influenced by changes in crystal structure, with in-plane lattice contraction increasing interactions between atoms. The hybridization of Cr and Ge states at low temperature impacts band broadening, lattice contraction, and interlayer interactions. The text highlights the importance of the interplay between Ueff and SOC in inducing 2D ferromagnetism in CrGeTe3, making it a promising candidate for strain engineering and spintronic applications.
