Keloids are benign skin lesions resulting from abnormal wound healing, with a potential genetic predisposition in individuals with darker skin. The pathogenesis involves hyper-proliferative fibroblasts and growth factors like TGFβ. The long non-coding RNA HOXA11-AS plays a role in keloid formation by regulating miR-124-3p and TGFβR1, impacting fibroblast behavior. The study suggests targeting HOXA11-AS or increasing miR-124-3p levels as potential treatments for keloids. The research involved cell transfection, histological examinations, qRT-PCR, Western blot analysis, and functional assays to elucidate the molecular mechanisms. The study identified a novel HOXA11-AS/miR-124-3p/TGFβR1 axis promoting keloid formation, highlighting potential therapeutic strategies. Limitations include a small sample size, necessitating further research with larger cohorts for validation and clinical translation.
