The text discusses a study on the impact of intraocular pressure (IOP) on optic nerve head (ONH) connective tissue damage in glaucomatous cupping, focusing on 3D histomorphometric quantification of ONH and peripapillary neural and connective tissues in monkeys with early experimental glaucoma. The study involved inducing moderate IOP elevations in monkeys and examining structural changes in the ONH. Researchers reconstructed 3D models of the ONH and peripapillary scleral connective tissues to detect permanent deformation, which could indicate early neuropathic damage. The study aimed to understand the biomechanical behavior of the ONH and its susceptibility to glaucoma. Findings showed differences in lamina cribrosa thickness and position in normal and glaucomatous eyes, with permanent deformation and thickening observed in early glaucomatous damage. The study also highlighted the importance of the scleral flange in connective tissue architecture and its vulnerability to posterior deformation. The research aims to characterize ONH and peripapillary scleral connective tissue architecture accurately to understand individual susceptibility to glaucomatous damage. Visualizing specific eye structures in 3D can help estimate susceptibility to IOP and determine appropriate treatment targets. These deep structural changes may serve as potential markers for glaucoma development and progression.
