Pre-eclampsia is a serious health condition affecting pregnant women, characterized by proteinuria and hypertension, typically occurring around 32 weeks of gestation. It affects 2-8% of pregnant women and is influenced by various risk factors. Research indicates that inadequate vascular remodeling of maternal spiral arteries due to trophoblast invasion failure is a key factor in pre-eclampsia development. MicroRNAs, such as miR-210, have been identified as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in pre-eclampsia. Studies have shown that miR-210 plays a role in enhancing cell viability, migration, and invasion in trophoblastic cells. PTPN2, a downstream target of miR-210, has been found to suppress cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. The study suggests that miR-210 and PTPN2 could serve as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for diagnosing and treating pre-eclampsia. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms involved in the miR-210-PTPN2 pathway in pre-eclampsia.
