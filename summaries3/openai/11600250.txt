Cytokines, particularly interleukin-6 (IL-6), play a crucial role in immune and inflammatory responses. IL-6 is influenced by various signals and, along with IL-1β, mediates inflammatory and immune responses triggered by infection or injury. Acute phase proteins, including positive acute phase proteins, are released in response to trauma and impact fibrinolysis and inflammation. A study investigated the effects of Trypsin-Chymotrypsin on acute-phase protein synthesis and cytokine levels in burn patients, finding a reduction in IL-1β and IL-6 levels with treatment. The study involved monitoring clinical parameters and wound healing in burn patients. Trypsin-Chymotrypsin treatment led to reduced edema, inflammation, and pain, faster wound healing, and softer final scars compared to the control group. The study suggests that the treatment positively impacted cytokine levels and wound healing outcomes. Additionally, the text discusses the role of cytokines in sepsis pathogenesis following burn injury and the potential benefits of inhibiting cytokine synthesis to reduce sepsis morbidity and mortality. Previous research has shown that measuring circulating IL-6 concentration in extensive burns can be influential in predicting outcomes. Overall, the text highlights the importance of cytokines, acute-phase proteins, and Trypsin-Chymotrypsin in
