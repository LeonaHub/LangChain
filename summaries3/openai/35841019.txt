A research project aims to address deficiencies in end-of-life care for dialysis patients by implementing the Shared Decision Making â€” Renal Supportive Care (SDM-RSC) intervention. This intervention focuses on improving communication, prognosis estimation, and transition planning through goals of care conversations. The project, known as HIGHway, involves training social workers and nurses in Advance Care Planning (ACP) and supporting them over a 9-month period to implement and refine processes. The project aims to integrate ACP seamlessly into regular workflow in dialysis centers, with a focus on person-centered approaches and empathy. Stakeholder engagement is crucial, with a national advisory council guiding the project. The project involves recording conversations between healthcare providers and patients, with consent, and evaluating the fidelity and effectiveness of the intervention through various methods. The success of the project is measured through high-quality communication in ACP conversations and completion of ACP discussions. The goal is to make advance care planning a routine part of patient care in dialysis centers.
