The text discusses the role of lipid-derived electrophiles (LDEs) in the central nervous system (CNS), particularly focusing on their production from polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in neuronal membranes due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. It highlights the implications of LDEs in neurodegenerative diseases and their correlation with ROS levels. The text also explores the evolution of strategies to study LDE signaling, such as activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) and the development of techniques like T-REX for target identification and signaling validation. It delves into the regulation of the Keap1/Nrf2/Antioxidant Response signaling pathway in diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS) and the potential therapeutic benefits of Nrf2 activation. Additionally, it discusses the mechanism of action of dimethyl fumarate (DMF) in treating MS, emphasizing the complex interplay between various pathways beyond Nrf2 activation. The text underscores the importance of further research to understand the effects of electroph
