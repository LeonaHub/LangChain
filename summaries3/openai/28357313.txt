Leishmaniasis is a significant tropical disease caused by parasites from the Trypanosomatidae family, affecting millions globally. Current treatments are limited, prompting research into new drugs targeting specific parasite pathways like ergosterol biosynthesis. The text discusses the synthesis and evaluation of ergosterone-triazol hybrid molecules as potential inhibitors for leishmaniasis treatment. These compounds showed promising antileishmanial effects, inducing cell death mechanisms in Leishmania promastigotes. The study also explored the compounds' impact on mitochondrial function, cell cycle progression, and reactive oxygen species production. The unique mechanism of action of these molecules involves mitochondrial hyperpolarization and ROS production, leading to parasite cell death through regulated processes. The compounds are considered potential candidates for developing new chemotherapeutic agents for leishmaniasis. The text details the experimental methods used in chemical synthesis studies, including techniques like TLC, NMR spectroscopy, and column chromatography. Various compounds were synthesized and evaluated for their biological activity on Leishmania promastigotes and human fibroblasts, showing high selectivity and effectiveness. Further modifications could enhance their potential as antileishmanial drugs.
