Orthodontic patients often experience anxiety and discomfort during treatment, with pain peaking around 24 hours after force application and diminishing by the seventh day. Various methods, including pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches, are used to alleviate pain. NSAIDs like tenoxicam have been shown to provide pain relief without affecting tooth movement, making it a convenient option for orthodontic pain management. A study compared the effectiveness of chewing gum and tenoxicam for pain relief after initial archwire placement in orthodontic patients, finding no significant difference in pain control between the two groups. Chewing gum has been suggested as a cost-effective and safe alternative for orthodontic pain management. The study emphasized the need for further research to establish a standard protocol for pain management during orthodontic treatment.
