Molybdenum is an essential element for living organisms, incorporated into biological systems as part of the molybdenum cofactor (Moco) in enzymes known as molybdopterin enzymes. These enzymes play a crucial role in catalyzing redox reactions by utilizing the chemical versatility of molybdenum. Most molybdenum-dependent enzymes use the metal in a mononuclear form coordinated to pyranopterins, except for bacterial nitrogenases which utilize a multinuclear MoFe7 cluster. Molybdopterin enzymes have a diverse range of molybdenum coordinating ligands, leading to their classification into three families: xanthine oxidase (XO), sulfite oxidase (SO), and dimethyl sulfoxide reductase (DMSOR). Eukaryotic Mo enzymes are found in the SO or XO families, while prokaryotic Mo/W enzymes can belong to all three families. Crystallographic studies have provided insights into the structure and mechanisms of various molybdenum-containing enzymes, such as nitrate reductases, which play a crucial
