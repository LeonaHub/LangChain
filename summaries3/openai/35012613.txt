Breast cancer incidence rates vary globally, with higher rates in Western countries and lower rates in Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia. Breast cancer can be classified into different subtypes based on hormone receptor status and HER2 status, which have distinct behaviors and responses to treatment. Studies in the U.S. and Norway have shown differences in breast cancer incidence and survival among racial/ethnic groups and immigrant populations. Immigrant women from low- and middle-income countries may have more advanced stages of breast cancer, potentially influenced by socioeconomic factors and disparities in healthcare access. Research in Norway has examined breast cancer subtypes among immigrant groups, finding differences in subtype distribution and incidence rates compared to non-immigrants. The study utilized national health data and found that immigrants from different regions had varying rates of breast cancer subtypes, with some immigrant groups having lower rates of luminal A-like tumors and higher rates of HER2+ and TNBC subtypes. Differences in breast cancer subtypes among immigrant groups may be influenced by genetics, lifestyle, and healthcare-seeking behavior. Acculturation and screening practices may also impact breast cancer subtype distribution among immigrant populations. The study emphasized the importance of considering detailed subgroups in cancer research to understand differences in etiology and prognosis based on cancer subtypes and birth country groupings. The text also discussed the impact of age distribution, time since immigration, and immigration patterns on breast cancer subtype distribution among immigrant populations in Norway.
