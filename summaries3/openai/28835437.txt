Platelets play a crucial role in development and hemostasis, with C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (CLEC-2) being a key activatory surface receptor involved in platelet functions. Studies have been conducted using knockout mouse models and anti-CLEC-2 antibody injections to understand the receptor's functions. The text describes experiments involving CLEC-2 Y7A knockin mice to investigate the receptor's role in blood-lymph separation and thrombus stability. The Y7A mutation in CLEC-2 abolishes platelet responses to CLEC-2 agonists and replicates lymphatic defects observed in CLEC-2-deficient mice. The study found that CLEC-2 contributes to thrombus stability independently of hemITAM signaling. Chimeric Y7A KI mice showed destabilized hemostasis and thrombosis after treatment with INU1 Fab' fragments. The text also discusses the role of the CLEC-2 ectodomain in platelet aggregate formation and thrombus stability. Further research is needed to identify the ligand responsible for CLEC-2's adhesive role in thrombosis and hemostasis.
