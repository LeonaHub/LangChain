Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific syndrome characterized by endothelial malfunction and vasospasm, occurring after 20 weeks of gestation. It is defined by symptoms like increased blood pressure, fluid retention, and proteinuria, which can progress rapidly to eclampsia, involving seizures or coma. Preeclampsia is a significant global health concern, particularly in India, affecting 8% to 10% of pregnant women. Risk factors include nulliparity, obesity, and maternal age over 35. Delayed diagnosis can lead to severe complications for both the mother and baby, including stillbirth and maternal death. Preeclampsia involves disrupted trophoblastic migration in maternal spiral arteries, leading to reduced blood flow and oxygen to the fetus. Studies have focused on lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels as a marker for preeclampsia severity, with elevated LDH levels associated with the condition. Research has shown changes in LDH isoenzyme patterns in preeclampsia and eclampsia cases, indicating potential endothelial pathology and hypoxia. LDH isoenzyme patterns in maternal serum and cord blood samples have been identified as reliable predictors of hypoxia and preeclampsia development. The text discusses the potential of LDH assessment, along with routine markers, for early risk assessment and management of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. However, the study acknowledges limitations such as a small sample size and the need for further validation through larger prospective studies.
