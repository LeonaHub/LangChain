Helminths, particularly Schistosoma worms, infect over a billion people globally, with Schistosoma haematobium causing urogenital schistosomiasis. Infections can lead to various health issues, including anaemia, reproductive problems, and increased susceptibility to other infections. The relationship between the parasite and host metabolism is crucial for the parasite's survival, with the parasite manipulating the host's metabolism to obtain essential nutrients. Studies have shown that schistosome infections impact host metabolism, particularly in energy, liver, and gut microbiota metabolism. A study in Zimbabwe analyzed metabolite profiles in preschool-aged children before and after S. haematobium infection, revealing changes in energy and purine metabolism. Males and females showed differences in amino acid metabolites, potentially due to muscle mass variations. Metabolic alterations in infected children included changes in energy-related pathways and purine metabolism, with liver injury and altered glucose utilization pathways observed. Treatment with praziquantel led to a reversal of metabolic changes, indicating a response to the infection. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying metabolic disturbances in schistosome infections and their impact on host health.
