Aedes aegypti is a significant global vector responsible for transmitting arboviruses such as dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. Originally from Africa, this species has evolved to adapt to human habitats, using artificial water containers as larval habitats and preferring humans as blood meal sources. Genetic data show significant differentiation between African and non-African populations of Ae. aegypti, with high genetic diversity observed even at a microgeographical scale. Understanding the population structure of Ae. aegypti can help prevent and control diseases transmitted by this vector. Studies have shown connections between population structure and urbanization levels and land use. Genetic and morphometric analyses have been used to study Ae. aegypti populations in different regions, providing insights into genetic variability, distribution, and adaptation of this important vector species. The study found high genetic diversity in northern Benin, with greater diversity in semi-urban and sylvatic sites compared to urban sites. Wing size and shape in mosquitoes are influenced by environmental and genetic factors, with wing size being more sensitive to environmental changes. The study also found a significant difference in wing size among mosquito specimens from different landscape types, with the semi-urban site having the highest centroid size. However, there was only a tendency for a difference in wing shape among landscape types. The research contributes to a deeper understanding of the biology of Ae. aegypti and the factors influencing its population structure and genetic diversity.
