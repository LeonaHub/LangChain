The text discusses the crucial interaction between the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and promoter TATA sequences in gene transcription in eukaryotes. It highlights the complex binding mechanisms, including TBP-induced helical distortion of DNATATA, and the influence of the TATA sequence on bending. The C-terminal DNA binding domains of TBPs from yeast, human, and Arabidopsis thaliana are highly conserved, while the N-terminal domains vary between species. Crystallographic studies have shown similarities in the structures of TBPs from different species bound to DNATATA. Research focuses on the recognition mechanisms of TBP for promoter DNA and the solution structures of TBP-DNA complexes, using FRET analysis to study real-time kinetics and helical bending. Studies compare the behavior of full-length human TBP with yeast TBP, noting differences in binding strength, speed, and bend severity. The text also discusses the FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) process, which is used to study the distance-dependent energy transfer between fluorophores attached to biomolecules. The study compares the binding interactions and solution structures of TBP-DNA TATA complexes using human TBP and a specific DNA duplex, showing variations in binding isotherms, kinetics, and DNA bend angles based on single base pair substitutions in the TATA sequence. The text also discusses the kinetics of TBP-DNA association, highlighting multiphasic reactions and variations in binding mechanisms between human and
