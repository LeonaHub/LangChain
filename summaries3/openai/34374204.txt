The text discusses the high prevalence of hypertension in the United States, with many adults not having their blood pressure under control, leading to significant costs. It highlights the impact of patient non-adherence and clinician behavior on hypertension control. A study examined the relationship between clinicians' prevention and promotion focus and their adherence to guidelines for monthly follow-up visits for patients with uncontrolled blood pressure. Results showed that clinicians with a prevention focus were more likely to follow guidelines and schedule follow-up visits compared to those with a promotion focus. Patients were more likely to return for follow-up visits sooner if their clinician had a prevention-focused approach. The study also found that monthly visits may not be feasible for Federally Qualified Health Centers and suggests that the number of days between visits may better reflect clinicians' ability to see patients for follow-up. The text emphasizes the importance of patients completing monthly visits and suggests presenting guidelines as goals rather than obligations to improve clinician adherence. Further research is needed to explore the impact of Regulatory Focus Theory on clinician attitudes and adherence to guidelines.
