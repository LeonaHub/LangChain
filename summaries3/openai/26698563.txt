PEComa tumors are a newly defined type of tumor characterized by perivascular epithelioid cells (PECs) and include various neoplasms with perivascular epithelioid cell differentiation. One rare type is soft-tissue clear cell myomelanocytic tumor (CCMMT), primarily affecting the uterus but also found in the falciform ligament and gut. A case study discussed a 29-year-old woman with liver cancer rupture, initially diagnosed as hepatic adenoma but later revealed to be CCMMT in the hepatic falciform ligament. Hepatic PEComa is more common in women aged 40-70 years and can be mistaken for hepatocellular carcinoma. Imaging findings for PEComa tumors can vary, with CT and MRI scans showing specific characteristics like arterial phase strengthening and equidense appearance in delayed scanning. Immunohistochemistry plays a crucial role in diagnosing PEComa, with markers like HMB-45, melan-A, and SMA typically expressed. Differential diagnosis of CCMMT involves cell morphology and immunohistochemistry, distinguishing it from other tumors like clear cell sarcoma and malignant mesothelioma. The text also discusses the potential use of mTOR inhibitors in treating malignant PEComa and the need for further studies on PEComa behavior and prognosis.
