Mitochondrial dysfunction and free radical formation, particularly through nitric oxide-mediated oxidative damage, are associated with neuronal cell death in Parkinson's disease. Studies have shown increased nitric oxide synthase in affected brain regions, contributing to neurodegeneration. The text discusses the role of 7-nitroindazole in reducing toxicity on baboons by inhibiting neuronal nitric oxide synthase. Nitric oxide toxicity leads to peroxynitrite production, inhibits the mitochondrial respiratory chain, and increases reactive oxygen species production. Indole β-carbolines, like harmalol and harmine, have been studied for their protective effects against neurotoxicity induced by SNAP in PC12 cells. These compounds inhibit mitochondrial membrane permeability changes, cytochrome c release, and caspase-3 activation, reducing ROS formation and restoring GSH levels. The study suggests that β-carbolines and R-(-)-deprenyl have neuroprotective effects by suppressing mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent cell death.β-carbolines have shown protective effects against cytotoxicity, but their efficacy may decrease at higher concentrations. Further research is needed to understand their potential as neuroprotective agents and their impact on neuronal cells in Parkinson's disease.
