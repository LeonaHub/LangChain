Breast cancer is a significant global health concern, with traditional treatments like radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery being commonly used. Nanotechnology, specifically nanoformulation of chemotherapeutics, is being explored to enhance drug properties and reduce side effects. Platinum-based chemotherapies, such as nedaplatin, are commonly used for solid tumors like breast cancer, but resistance and toxic reactions limit their effectiveness. Nanotechnology is being investigated to improve the delivery and effectiveness of these chemotherapeutics. Chitosan nanoparticles are being developed as drug delivery vehicles due to their biodegradability and biocompatibility. Studies have shown that chitosan nanoparticles loaded with specific drugs, such as betamethasone and nystatin, can improve drug release and cytotoxicity against cancer cells. Animal experiments have been conducted to assess the efficacy of these nanoparticles in reducing tumor size. PEGylation of nanoparticles has been found to enhance drug loading capacity and cytotoxic activity against cancer cells. The combination of betamethasone and nystatin in PEGylated chitosan nanoparticles has shown promising results in reducing tumor size and enhancing antitumor activity. Overall, these findings suggest that nanoformulations, particularly chitosan nanoparticles, have the potential to be effective therapeutic options for breast cancer treatment.
