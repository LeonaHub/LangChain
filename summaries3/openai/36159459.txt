The text discusses the importance of gut microbiota (GM) in maintaining human health, emphasizing its positive effects on immunity and blood lipid reduction. It highlights the role of beneficial microbiota in regulating intestinal discomfort and the impact of diet on GM composition. Dietary fiber, particularly from sweet potatoes, is explored for its benefits in promoting human health by regulating gut microbiota. Different extraction methods are discussed, with a focus on the effects of dietary fiber on intestinal fermentation. The study examines the impact of dietary fiber from sweet potato peels on gas production, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) content, and microbial diversity in the gut. Results show that dietary fiber, especially from sweet potatoes, can enhance SCFA production, reduce pH and ammonia levels, and improve the balance of beneficial and harmful gut bacteria. The study suggests that dietary fiber extracted through ultrasonic methods has the most significant positive impact on gut health.
