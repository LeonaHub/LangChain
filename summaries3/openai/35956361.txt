Vitamin A is crucial for various bodily functions, especially for lactating women and infants. Vitamin A deficiency is a significant issue in developing countries, impacting breast milk quality and infant health. Studies in China have shown variations in breast milk retinol concentrations and the importance of dietary intake for maintaining adequate vitamin A levels. Laboratory procedures were detailed for analyzing vitamin A levels in blood and breast milk samples. A study in urban China investigated vitamin A intake, blood, and breast milk concentrations among lactating women, highlighting the impact of dietary sources and BMI categories on vitamin A levels. The study emphasized the need for nutritional education and further research to address vitamin A deficiency risks. The text also discusses the importance of maternal dietary intake for vitamin A status, the influence of body weight on vitamin A levels, and the potential risks of vitamin A deficiency in lactating women and their infants. The study found positive associations between dietary, serum, and breast milk vitamin A levels, underscoring the importance of food-based interventions and health education to prevent deficiencies.
