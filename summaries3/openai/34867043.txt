Breast cancer is a prevalent cancer in females, with factors like genetic mutations, aging, lifestyle changes, and exposure to environmental pollutants contributing to its development. Chemicals like DMBA and TCDD induce breast cancer by activating the AhR/CYP1 pathway, leading to cancer initiation. Metformin, an anti-hyperglycemic drug, has shown anti-cancer activity by inhibiting this pathway. A study investigated the chemopreventive effect of metformin on AhR-induced breast carcinogenesis in a rat model. Results showed metformin reduced the expression of AhR, CYP1A1, and CYP1B1, induced apoptosis, and inhibited cell cycle proliferation. Metformin also blocked mammosphere formation, a marker for cancer stem cells. The study suggests metformin's potential as a safer chemopreventive agent against breast cancer through its inhibitory effects on the AhR/CYP1 pathway. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and explore metformin's enzymatic activities.
