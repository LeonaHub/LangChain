Gout is a chronic disease caused by MSU crystal deposition in joints, leading to painful flares. The NLRP3 inflammasome is central to the inflammation caused by these crystals, with gout flares occurring due to a two-step process of inflammasome activation. Exposure to MSU crystals can prime the inflammasome for activation, with gout flares often occurring at night due to circadian rhythms regulating inflammatory processes. A study investigated how MSU crystals affect the circadian clock in macrophages, finding time-of-day variations in NLRP3 inflammasome activity. The study used THP-1 macrophages and found that BMAL1 and REV-ERBα regulate inflammasome activation, with BMAL1 exhibiting time-of-day-dependent repression. The study also explored the impact of heme and REV-ERBα on inflammasome activity, showing that these factors repress NLRP3 activation induced by MSU crystals. Overall, the study suggests that changes in the circadian clock due to MSU crystal exposure contribute to inflammasome activation and gout flares, with potential implications for other inflammatory conditions.
