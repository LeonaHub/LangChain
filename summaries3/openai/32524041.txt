Implanted neurostimulation devices like VNS, thalamic DBS, and RNS System are used as adjunctive treatments for drug-resistant epilepsy. Concerns exist about potential adverse effects on sleep, with studies focusing on the impact of RNS System on sleep. A study at UCSF analyzed the relationship between RNS System stimulations and disruptions in sleep using PSG. The study included subjects meeting specific criteria and used various measurements to assess sleep stages and arousals. Results showed that RNS stimulations did not cause arousals as expected, with arousals peaking before stimulation onset. The study also compared ECoG activity with PSG results, suggesting that epileptiform activity, rather than stimulations, may be responsible for arousals. The study concluded that RNS System stimulations did not seem to disrupt sleep in the small patient cohort. Further research is needed to understand the effects of neurostimulation on sleep, particularly in patients with thalamic RNS System leads, to develop more advanced devices with fewer side effects.
