Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis (IPH) is a rare disorder in children characterized by recurrent diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, hemoptysis, iron deficiency anemia, and pulmonary infiltrates. The incidence and prevalence of IPH are not well understood, but it can be fatal, with a mortality rate of up to 50%. Children with IPH have a poorer prognosis compared to adults, with a rapid course and potential death from acute massive pulmonary hemorrhage or respiratory insufficiency. Historically, patients had an average survival of 2.5 years, but recent studies show a 5-year survival rate of 86%. A retrospective study on 107 pediatric IPH cases in China found a median age of onset at 5 years and a median age of diagnosis at 6 years, with an average delay in diagnosis of 10.46 months. The study highlighted the variability in clinical presentation and the challenge of misdiagnosis, with common initial symptoms being cough, hemoptysis, fever, and dyspnea. Laboratory tests showed anemia in most patients, with iron deficiency being prevalent. Imaging and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis were crucial for diagnosis, with high rates of hemosiderin-laden macrophages found. Treatment typically involves glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive agents, with good response rates but high recurrence rates. Prognosis is influenced by early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, with long-term glucocorticoid therapy improving survival. Further research is needed to understand the etiology and optimal management of IPH in children.
