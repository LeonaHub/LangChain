Cancer incidence in Japan has been on the rise, leading to an increase in effective cancer treatments. The surge in new oncology drugs has resulted in longer treatment durations and higher drug costs. Despite advancements, some oncology patients in Japan face economic burdens due to treatment costs. Limited research has been conducted on why patients refuse or discontinue drug treatment, with economic reasons being a significant factor. Studies have shown that treatment costs are a concern for both physicians and patients, with a notable percentage expressing dissatisfaction due to high costs. Treatment costs can lead to non-optimal treatment decisions, particularly for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and transplant-ineligible multiple myeloma (MM) patients in Japan. Physician characteristics, such as age and type of facility, can influence treatment recommendations based on cost considerations. Overall, treatment cost is a significant factor in physicians not recommending optimal treatment, potentially leading to suboptimal treatment choices for some patients. Further research is needed to fully understand the impact of treatment cost on patient and physician decisions in Japan.
