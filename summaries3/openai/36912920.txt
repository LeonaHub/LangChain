Popliteal cysts, also known as Baker's cysts, are fluid-filled sacs in the knee joint often associated with underlying joint issues. Treatment options include nonoperative methods like corticosteroid injections and surgery for severe cases. A study evaluated the recurrence rate and functional outcomes of arthroscopic surgery for popliteal cysts, involving excising the cyst wall and valve while addressing intra-articular pathologies. The study found a 12.4% recurrence rate, with good functional outcomes post-surgery. Various studies have reported different recurrence rates for popliteal cysts, with some showing success with arthroscopic cystectomy. The study emphasized the importance of addressing concomitant intra-articular lesions to prevent cyst recurrence. The surgical technique described in the study had low recurrence rates and good functional outcomes, but severe chondral lesions increased the risk of recurrence. The study's strengths included a large cohort and strict follow-up protocol, but limitations included varying follow-up times and a younger age group. Overall, arthroscopic treatment for popliteal cysts showed positive outcomes with low recurrence rates, especially when addressing associated joint pathologies.
