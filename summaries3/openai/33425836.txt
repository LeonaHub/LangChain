During the COVID-19 pandemic, restrictions have been implemented worldwide, impacting healthcare professionals who must balance virus prevention with patient care. Patients with serious psychiatric illnesses are particularly vulnerable, facing increased risks of infection and mortality. To address these challenges, many healthcare facilities have turned to telemedicine, particularly in the field of psychiatry, where communication is key. Telepsychiatry has shown promise in providing continuous care, especially for patients in rural areas. However, challenges remain in delivering group therapies through telemedicine due to technical and privacy issues. To support psychiatric patients during lockdowns, a clinic in Regensburg, Germany, launched an online blog, providing information, tips, and peer support. The blog aimed to engage patients and maintain a sense of connection during uncertain times. While the blog received positive feedback, challenges in patient involvement and feedback collection were noted. The text emphasizes the importance of enhancing telehealth interventions for psychiatric patients and improving communication structures to support patients during public health crises.
