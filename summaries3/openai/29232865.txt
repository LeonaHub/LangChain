Air pollution, specifically air pollutants like particulate matter, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide, has been associated with various health issues, including cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, as well as spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH). Research has shown conflicting results regarding the correlation between sICH and air pollutants. A study in Taiwan utilized the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) and governmental open data to analyze the relationship between air pollutants and sICH in Taiwanese patients. The study included 39,053 sICH cases from five regions in Taiwan and found correlations between pollutants like PM10, PM2.5, and NO2 with sICH in middle-aged and elderly patients. The study also highlighted the need for further research to adjust air pollution control policies and cut-off levels based on findings. Age was identified as a significant factor influencing how air pollutants affect sICH incidence, with PM2.5 and PM10 being important risk factors for sICH in middle-aged and elderly patients. The study suggested incorporating laboratory data and multivariate analysis in future research to better understand the impact of air pollutants on sICH.
