The text discusses the structural and functional diversity of human plasma fibrinogen, particularly focusing on the γ chain variants γ50, γ55, and γ57.5. These variants, produced through alternative RNA processing, have unique C-terminal sequences that impact factor XIIIa-mediated crosslinking and platelet-fibrinogen interactions. Studies involving synthetic peptides and monoclonal antibodies like MoAb L2B explore the specificity of binding to these variants and their effects on platelet aggregation and fibrinogen binding. The text also delves into the role of specific residues in the Aα chain and γ chain sequences in mediating platelet interactions. Research findings suggest that fibrinogen γ57.5, despite its reduced binding and aggregation support compared to γ50, interacts with platelets primarily through the γ50 chain. The investigation further identifies key residues, such as R-409-PEH-412, in the γ57.5 chain that are crucial for binding MoAb L2B and influencing platelet-fibrinogen interactions. Additionally, the text discusses the exposure of the L2B epitope in fibrin clots, supporting the predicted secondary structure and hydrophilicity of the γ57.5 C-terminus. The findings highlight the significance of specific sequences in fibrinogen variants in modulating hemostatic events and platelet aggregation.
