The text discusses the challenges in diagnosing oral cancers, particularly oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), due to the presence of potentially malignant disorders and precancerous conditions in the oral mucosa. Various methods, such as Lugol's iodine staining and autofluorescent imaging, are used for non-invasive screening of the oral mucosa. The IllumiScan fluorescence visualization device is highlighted for its compact design and real-time digital data capture capabilities. Studies have shown the effectiveness of IllumiScan in detecting OSCC and leukoplakia, with high sensitivity for OSCC but lower specificity for leukoplakia. The text also mentions the use of narrow band imaging (NBI) for examining oral mucosal lesions and the comparison of different examination methods like macroscopy, IOM, IllumiScan, and NBI. Additionally, the text discusses the importance of intratumoral heterogeneity in oral cancer and suggests that combining the IllumiScan device with other screening methods could improve diagnostic accuracy for detecting OSCC, especially in keratinized mucosa.
