Glaucoma is a complex optic neuropathy associated with visual field loss and optic nerve degeneration, often due to increased intraocular pressure. It is a leading cause of blindness globally and is classified into primary congenital glaucoma, primary open-angle glaucoma, and primary angle-closure glaucoma. Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) is a significant cause of blindness in China, affecting millions of individuals. Genetic factors, including mutations in genes like LTBP2, have been implicated in various forms of glaucoma, such as primary congenital glaucoma and PACG. Studies have identified mutations in LTBP2 in individuals with angle closure glaucoma and other related conditions, suggesting a potential link between LTBP2 mutations and glaucoma. Research has shown that LTBP2 may be involved in the development of PACG, with mutations potentially impacting the extracellular matrix and contributing to the disease. While mutations in LTBP2 may not be the sole cause of PACG, they likely interact with other factors to influence disease manifestation. Further research is needed to explore the role of LTBP2 mutations in larger groups of PACG patients and investigate their impact on the extracellular matrix.
