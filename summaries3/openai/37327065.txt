Sepsis is a challenging condition to diagnose and a leading cause of death in the United States, especially in critically ill patients in intensive care units. Early identification of sepsis is crucial for patient survival, but it remains a significant challenge. Prehospital identification of acute and critical illnesses, including sepsis, is essential for early treatment to reduce mortality and morbidity. However, many EMS personnel lack a comprehensive understanding of how to recognize and treat sepsis, hindering proper prehospital care. Various Early Warning Scores (EWS) have been used to identify sepsis in prehospital settings, but their performance has been inconsistent across studies. While some EWS have shown promise, most are not reliable indicators of sepsis in this context. Experts recommend implementing standardized prehospital protocols, enhancing sepsis education, and exploring new research areas to improve prehospital care for sepsis. Incorporating real-time diagnostic modalities like end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) monitoring is suggested to aid in identifying prehospital sepsis. Despite the ongoing development in prehospital sepsis research, there is limited evidence to support using EWS as the primary method for identifying sepsis in this setting. Standardizing prehospital care and interventions, improving sepsis education, and providing EMS personnel with real-time data and feedback are recommended to enhance care for septic patients.
