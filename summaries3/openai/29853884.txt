Adiponectin, traditionally known for its role in energy storage, was discovered in the late 1980s to have endocrine functions, producing bioactive peptides called adipokines. Adiponectin is involved in various physiological processes, including metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and anti-inflammatory responses. It circulates in different forms in the body and is mainly produced by white adipose tissue. Adiponectin and its receptors are expressed in reproductive organs, suggesting a role in regulating reproductive functions. Adiponectin influences the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovarian axis, uterus, and early gestation, affecting hormone secretion and gene expression in various tissues. It plays a significant role in oocyte maturation, steroidogenesis, and prostaglandin synthesis in the ovaries and uterus. Adiponectin also impacts embryo development and maternal-fetal interactions, influencing blastocyst formation and trophoblast function. The adiponectin system is implicated in maternal-fetal interactions and placental function, with effects on energy
