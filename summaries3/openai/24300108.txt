Exposure to ethanol during pregnancy can lead to preventable birth defects and long-term deficits in physical and cognitive growth. Ethanol exposure during vulnerable periods of brain growth can trigger neurodegeneration in rodents, although the exact mechanisms are not fully understood. Histone and epigenetic alterations play a role in human developmental disorders, with chromatin remodeling through histone methylation being a well-studied mechanism. Euchromatic histone methyltransferases like G9a and GLP are crucial for cognitive function and neuronal development, with G9a knockout leading to cognitive deficits. Studies have shown that exposure to high doses of ethanol can lead to reduced levels of DNMT mRNA and affect histone genes involved in epigenetic regulation. Inhibiting G9a activity can prevent ethanol-induced neurodegeneration in neonatal mice. The study utilized various techniques such as immunohistochemistry, Western blot analysis, qPCR, and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays to investigate the effects of ethanol exposure on gene expression and histone modifications in the hippocampus and cortex of neonatal mice. The study found that low-dose ethanol exposure can lead to mild neurodegeneration by affecting histone modifications and gene transcription, with G9a playing a crucial role in this process. Inhibiting G9a activity with a specific inhibitor (Bix) can rescue neurodegeneration in neonatal mice. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms at play and explore potential therapeutic interventions for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD).
