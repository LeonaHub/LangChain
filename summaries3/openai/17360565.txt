The text discusses the theme of self-regulation in the immune response, focusing on the role of the Foxp3 transcription factor in regulating regulatory T cell development and function. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the biochemical mechanisms involved in distinguishing self and non-self in the immune system. The study investigates the role of Foxp3 as a transcriptional repressor in human regulatory T cells by examining its interaction with histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). The balance between histone acetylation and deacetylation is crucial for chromatin remodeling during T cell development. Abnormalities in HAT and HDAC have been linked to diseases such as leukemia, diabetes, and immune system disorders. The text also discusses the association of Foxp3 with Class II HDAC7 and HDAC9 in human CD4+CD25+ T cells for transcriptional repression. It identifies specific regions of Foxp3 crucial for this function and shows that Foxp3 is acetylated in regulatory T cells, a process facilitated by HAT TIP60. The study explores the impact of TIP60 on Foxp3-mediated repression and the association of Foxp3 with HDAC7 and HDAC9. It also delves into the stoichiometric relationship of the Foxp3-TIP60-HDAC7 complex in repressing IL-2 production in T cells. The text suggests that signals affecting TIP60 function or HDAC activity may alter T cell suppression. Additionally, it discusses the dynamic nature of Foxp3 complex ensembles in response to T cell receptor signals and proposes potential pharmaceutical approaches to modify regulatory
