Preterm birth is a significant concern in twin pregnancies, with a higher rate compared to singleton pregnancies. Identifying twin pregnancies at risk of preterm birth is crucial, especially for those with a history of prior singleton preterm birth. Monitoring factors such as a short cervix identified through transvaginal ultrasound between 16-24 weeks of gestation can help predict the risk of preterm delivery in twin pregnancies. A short cervical length in twin pregnant women increases the risk of spontaneous preterm birth significantly. Studies have explored the use of shear wave elastography (SWE) to assess cervical softness in pregnant women, with SWE being preferred over strain elastography (SE) due to its ability to provide more accurate measurements. Research has shown that SWE can detect differences in cervical softness between twin and singleton pregnancies, particularly at the lower point of the cervix during mid-trimester. The study also highlighted the impact of age differences between twin and singleton pregnant women on collagen content in the cervix. Further research is needed to fully understand the potential of SWE for monitoring cervical softness changes in twin pregnancies and its role in preterm surveillance.
