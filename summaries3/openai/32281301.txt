Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a poor prognosis, with treatment options varying based on tumor resectability and distant metastasis. Surgical resection is the main curative treatment for PDAC without distant metastasis, but only a small percentage of cases are resectable at diagnosis. Adjuvant chemotherapy improves prognosis, and neoadjuvant therapy increases the likelihood of successful resection for unresectable cases. The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline is commonly used to evaluate treatment effects in many cancers, but it is not ideal for PDAC. 18F‐Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F‐FDG‐PET) is suggested as a superior alternative to CT for evaluating treatment effects in various cancers, including PDAC. The Positron Emission Tomography Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (PERCIST) with FDG-PET is used to assess treatment effects in PDAC patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy. Studies have shown that metabolic tumor volume (MTV) measured on FDG-PET/CT can reflect tumor cell activity and prognosis in various cancers, including PDAC. PERCIST criteria categorize response as progressive metabolic disease (PMD), stable metabolic disease (SMD), partial metabolic response (PMR), and complete metabolic response (CMR) based on changes in SULpeak values. The reduction rate of metabolic tumor volume (MTV) before and after neoadjuvant therapy is a significant predictor of recurrence and survival in PDAC patients. PERCIST, particularly using SULpeak, is more accurate than RECIST in assessing the therapeutic effect of neoadjuvant treatment on PDAC. The study found that underestimating the therapeutic effect of neoadjuvant therapy in pancreatic cancer patients may lead to delays in curative resection and cancer progression. The change rate of MTV on PET/CT before and after neoadjuvant therapy is an independent prognostic factor for PDAC. Limitations include the need for consistent PET/CT protocols and high costs. Future studies with larger sample sizes are recommended.
