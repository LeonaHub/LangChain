Biodegradable polymers like PCL are widely used in tissue engineering due to their processing ease and biocompatibility, but predicting their in vivo performance accurately is challenging due to property variability. PCL can be degraded through hydrolytic or enzymatic pathways and is used in tissue engineering applications like vascular grafting. Research on PCL's in vivo performance as vascular grafts has yielded diverse data, with concerns about complications like calcification if scaffolds remain un-resorbed. Studies have observed implant mineralization in various animal models, including those using PCL. The text details a study analyzing the tissue response and complications following the implantation of electrospun PCL grafts in a rat abdominal aorta replacement model over 180 days. The study involved fabricating vascular scaffolds using electrospinning, sterilizing them, and conducting in vivo experiments on rats following ethical guidelines. Postoperative care, imaging diagnostics, and histological analysis were performed to assess graft performance. Findings showed varying tissue responses to PCL grafts, with some cases of inflammation, calcification, and encapsulation observed. The study also discussed the impact of inflammation on graft outcomes and the importance of understanding cell differentiation in scaffold remodeling. Further research is needed to address concerns about long-term performance and sustainability of biodegradable scaffolds in tissue engineering applications.
