The text discusses the importance of physical activity for overall health and the challenges in meeting recommended activity levels, particularly the 10,000 steps per day guideline. It highlights the role of social comparison in motivating individuals to increase physical activity, especially through technology-based interventions like Fitbit challenges. The studies described in the text use single-case experimental designs to investigate the impact of exposure to social comparison information during Fitbit challenges on physical activity in sedentary adults. Results show that participants displayed varying responses to the challenges, with some showing increases in daily steps while others did not. The text emphasizes the need for further research to understand the effects of social comparison on behavior change efforts and the factors influencing individual responses to competition and comparison. It also discusses limitations of using Fitbit devices for interventions and suggests future research directions to enhance the effectiveness of competitive arrangements in promoting physical activity.
