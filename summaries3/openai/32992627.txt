The text discusses the integration of quantum dots (QDs) into biomolecules for applications in biology and medicine, focusing on the toxicity and potential environmental impact of heavy metal-based QDs like Cd-based QDs. It explores the toxicity of CdTe QDs in various cell lines and the shift towards developing eco-friendly InP QDs. Studies on InP/ZnS QDs suggest lower toxicity compared to Cd-based QDs, but conflicting reports exist. Research examines the renal toxicity of InP/ZnS QDs in mice, showing varying effects on kidney function, oxidative stress, and apoptosis based on surface modifications. The study methodology involves analyzing biochemical parameters, histopathology, oxidative stress markers, and gene expression in kidney tissues. The text highlights the importance of surface modifications in QDs for biocompatibility and potential risks, emphasizing the need for further research to understand their toxicity mechanisms comprehensively.
