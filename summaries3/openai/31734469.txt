Eosinophils are crucial in inflammatory diseases like bronchial asthma, with therapies targeting eosinophils proving beneficial for patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. Eosinophils develop from CD34 + progenitor cells in the bone marrow, influenced by cytokines like interleukin (IL)-5. Eosinophils express various receptors and release mediators stored in granules for their effector functions. They play roles in both innate and adaptive immune responses, beyond inflammatory diseases. Eosinophils are involved in promoting the maturation of dendritic cells and can express molecules necessary for antigen presentation to T cells. The IL-5/IL-5Rα axis influences eosinophil biology, and therapies like benralizumab target this axis to combat eosinophilic asthma. The text discusses the importance of measuring airway bronchial eosinophilia in asthmatic patients and the potential impact of eosinophil reduction on immune responses against parasites, viruses, and tumors. The safety concerns associated with eosinophil-lowering treatments are also highlighted, with a focus on benralizumab's unique dual mechanism of action and its safety profile. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of eosinophils in various conditions and the effects of eosinophil-lowering therapies on immune responses.
