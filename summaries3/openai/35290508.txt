Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is crucial for diagnosing and staging prostate cancer, aiding in identifying suspicious lesions and guiding treatment decisions. Studies have examined the accuracy of mpMRI in local staging using techniques like radiomics and artificial intelligence. The text discusses ongoing debates on the use of mpMRI for staging prostate cancer and the development of scoring systems to assess extraprostatic extension. A study aimed to evaluate specific parameters in predicting extraprostatic extension, leading to the development of a comprehensive mEPE-score. The mEPE-score showed good diagnostic performance, with varying sensitivity and specificity for different features related to extraprostatic extension. The study compared the mEPE-score with other scoring systems and found it to be comparable or superior in performance. The text emphasizes the importance of using standardized scoring systems to improve diagnostic accuracy in prostate cancer detection using mpMRI.
