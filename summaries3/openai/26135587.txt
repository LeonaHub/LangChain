Primary Sj√∂gren's Syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune disease that predominantly affects females and primarily impacts exocrine glands, leading to symptoms like dry eyes and dry mouth. Patients may also experience pain, fatigue, neurological symptoms, sleep disturbances, and an increased risk of developing lymphoma, resulting in reduced quality of life and increased healthcare costs. Non-pharmacological interventions for pSS can target specific symptoms and involve multiple healthcare professionals, offering benefits in improving symptoms, quality of life, work capacity, and reducing economic costs. Studies have examined various non-pharmacological interventions for pSS, such as punctal plugs for dry eyes, acupuncture for dry mouth, and psychodynamic group therapy. However, the effectiveness of these interventions remains inconclusive due to limitations in study quality, including high risk of bias, small sample sizes, and poor data presentation. Further research is recommended to investigate the impact of non-pharmacological interventions on daily activities, quality of life, and symptom management in pSS patients. Additionally, while punctal plugs may offer relief for severe dry eyes, there is a lack of evidence supporting non-pharmacological interventions to enhance quality of life for pSS patients, highlighting the need for well-designed randomized controlled trials with patient-centered outcomes.
