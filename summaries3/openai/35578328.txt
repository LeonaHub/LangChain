Peer-led network interventions involve utilizing members of a community to implement behavior change interventions, particularly in schools, to address health behavior issues among adolescents and young adults. Peer leaders are considered credible, act as role models, and have informal communication routes to engage less-engaged individuals. Studies have shown the effectiveness of peer-led interventions in reducing HIV risk behaviors, cigarette smoking, and suicidal behaviors. However, there is limited use of peer-led interventions in schools, and research on the selection and implementation processes is still developing. Various methods, including opinion leadership and network analysis, are used to select influential peer leaders for interventions. The text discusses a study that implemented a peer-led suicide prevention program in high schools, emphasizing the importance of selecting diverse and well-connected peer leaders. The study analyzed the characteristics of peer leaders, their proximity to at-risk students, and the concordance between theoretical and adult-selected peer leader sets. The results showed that network-informed selection methods can improve the diversity and effectiveness of peer leaders in intervention diffusion. The text also highlights the significance of opinion leaders in delivering intervention messages effectively and suggests a hybrid approach involving visible opinion leaders and strategically placed key players within a network for optimal diffusion. Further research is recommended to explore the impact of different selection methods on intervention spread within school networks.
