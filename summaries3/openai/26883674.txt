Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder affecting 4% of adults, characterized by intermittent hypoxia, hypoxaemia, sleep fragmentation, and excessive daytime sleepiness. The severity of OSA and individual patient susceptibility play a role in its clinical consequences, which can be linked to various comorbidities, particularly cardiovascular disease (CVD). Research has shown a potential nonlinear relationship between OSA and dyslipidemia, with studies using various statistical analyses to explore this complex relationship. Studies have identified a non-linear, multistage relationship between OSA severity and the risk of dyslipidemia, with different lipid-related risk factors highlighted for each stage of OSA severity. The relationship between OSA severity and dyslipidemia risk is complex and non-monotonic, with factors like obesity consistently identified as independent risk factors across all stages. The use of mixed and multilevel statistical models has helped analyze this intricate relationship, emphasizing the need for further research to establish a causal relationship between OSA and dyslipidemia. Long-term studies and large-scale randomized controlled trials are necessary to fully understand the relationship between OSA and dyslipidemia, as well as its implications for cardiovascular health and other comorbidities.
