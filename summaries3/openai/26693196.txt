Glaucoma, particularly Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG), is a significant cause of irreversible blindness globally, affecting millions of people annually. Early detection through regular eye checks is crucial, as diagnosis often occurs late when significant eye damage has already occurred. Studies in Ghana and other African countries highlight the prevalence of glaucoma and the need for public education and awareness campaigns to address this public health issue. A study in Ghana aimed to assess awareness and knowledge of glaucoma among individuals aged forty and above, finding that higher education was associated with increased awareness. However, increased awareness did not always translate to knowledge about the condition. Other studies in different countries also found disparities in glaucoma awareness based on education levels and income. Despite high awareness rates in some populations, knowledge about glaucoma's clinical presentation was often low. The studies emphasize the importance of early diagnosis through routine eye examinations to prevent blindness due to glaucoma and the need for effective educational strategies to reduce late diagnosis.
