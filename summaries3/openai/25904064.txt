Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI IMS) combines mass spectrometry with histology to visualize biomolecules in tissue by generating mass spectra at different points on tissue sections coated with a matrix using a laser. This technique has been used to analyze various molecules in tissues, such as pharmaceuticals, metabolites, lipids, peptides, and proteins. Image spatial resolution in imaging mass spectrometry is determined by laser spot size and array spacing, with ion images providing a molecular dimension to histological analysis. Challenges exist in identifying observed peaks in protein imaging experiments, with strategies categorized as bottom-up, top-down, and indirect identification. Bottom-up proteomics is preferred for analyzing formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples, while top-down strategies offer an alternative approach by identifying intact proteins through on-tissue MS/MS analysis. Efforts have been made to increase ion charge states through supercharging matrices or ESI-like surface analysis techniques. Fourier transform mass spectrometers offer high mass resolution and accuracy, making them valuable for tissue analysis. MALDI FTICR IMS technology allows for high mass resolution and accuracy in identifying proteins, as demonstrated in the analysis of rat brain tissue. The text discusses the use of mass spectrometry imaging to analyze protein distributions in rat brain tissue and the identification of various proteins through mass spectrometry analysis. The study aims to characterize the proximity of calprotectin to proteins that generate reactive oxygen species and the potential oxidative damage to calprotectin by ROS. The text also highlights the importance of understanding the impact of oxidative damage on proteins during host-pathogen interactions. High mass accuracy and resolving power instrumentation are essential for confidently identifying proteins in these experiments.
