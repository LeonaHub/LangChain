Biological invasions by non-native species have significant impacts on biodiversity, ecosystems, and human well-being. The invasion process involves introduction, establishment, and dispersal phases, with global trade facilitating the introduction of non-native species. Managing introduction pathways is crucial for preventing invasions. Factors like climate matching, host availability, and dispersal vectors influence the establishment and spread of non-native species. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for early detection and control. A study assessed the risks of invasive species spreading through trade pathways in New Zealand. Network analysis is used to evaluate introduction risks of invasive species globally. Species distribution models and niche concepts help estimate suitable areas for invasive species under climate change conditions. Pine Wilt Disease (PWD) caused by pine wood nematodes has led to significant economic losses and forest damage in various countries. The spread of PWD in China is influenced by climate change, affecting the distribution of insect vectors. A risk assessment framework integrating network analysis and SDMs is proposed to assess PWD invasion risks. The study analyzed future climate data to predict PWN distribution and its insect vectors in China. The overlap between PWN, insect vectors, and hosts is crucial for understanding dispersal patterns. The study identified multiple pathways for PWN introduction into China and highlighted the importance of early warning and management strategies. Climate change impacts the distribution and interactions of PWN, its insect vectors, and hosts. The text emphasizes the need for assessing risks associated with PWN introduction, establishment, and dispersal in China, focusing on trade pathways and climate change effects. The study developed a risk assessment framework for PWD, considering introduction pathways, insect vectors, and hosts to evaluate invasion risks. It suggests biological control measures and strengthening prevention strategies in high-risk regions. The framework provides insights into mitigating risks associated with PWN introduction and dispersal, serving as a reference for invasive species management strategies.
