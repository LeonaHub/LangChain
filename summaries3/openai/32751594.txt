Thyroid cancer rates are increasing in developed countries, primarily low-risk papillary thyroid carcinoma cases. Treatment outcomes are generally positive, leading to stable mortality rates. There is a debate on overdiagnosis and overtreatment of thyroid cancers, with a shift towards risk-adapted management based on individual patient risk. Genetic mutations like BRAF V600E and TERT promoter mutations play a role in PTC development and prognosis. TERT promoter mutations are associated with worse outcomes, while BRAF V600E mutations alone do not significantly impact survival. Lobectomy is being considered as a suitable approach for low-risk PTC patients, but criteria for selecting patients for this approach are unclear. Studies suggest that lobectomy may provide similar outcomes to total thyroidectomy for patients without TERT promoter mutations. The study emphasizes the importance of genetic markers in determining the initial surgical approach for PTC patients. Further research involving multiple institutions is recommended to validate these findings.
