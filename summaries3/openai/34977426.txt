The text discusses the complexity of the pain pathway, emphasizing the involvement of various cell types, spinal cord circuitry, neural traffic, and brain regions in the pain process. It highlights the importance of in vitro sensory neuron models in pain research due to practical advantages like reduced costs and ethical concerns. The text focuses on the advancements in human sensory neuron models, such as hDRG neurons and SC-SNs, and their potential for studying chronic pain mechanisms and validating analgesic targets. It compares the characteristics and applications of hDRG neurons and SC-SNs, noting their unique advantages and limitations. The text also addresses challenges in using these models, such as donor availability, culture conditions, and variability across differentiation batches. It emphasizes the need for standardized protocols and cross-validation of findings between human and rodent models to enhance preclinical pain research. Overall, the text advocates for leveraging the strengths of both human and rodent sensory neuron models to advance our understanding of pain biology and develop effective analgesic strategies.
