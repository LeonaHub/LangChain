Rabies is a deadly viral infection that primarily affects mammals, with dogs being the main source of human cases globally. The World Health Organization aims to eliminate rabies deaths by 2030, but urgent action is needed to achieve this goal. Rabies is present in about 100 countries worldwide and is mainly transmitted through bites from rabid animals. In Africa, rabies remains a significant public health concern, with dog vaccination being the most effective prevention method. However, low vaccination rates are attributed to weak legislative measures in many African countries. Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) is crucial in preventing human rabies deaths, but its availability is limited in rural areas, leading to delays in treatment. Studies have shown that delays in initiating PEP can impact its effectiveness. A study conducted in Ghana at the Korle-Bu teaching hospital aimed to investigate factors contributing to noncompliance with rabies PEP schedules. The study found that a significant portion of individuals exposed to suspected rabies were children, with dog bites being the most common. The study also highlighted the importance of immediate PEP initiation to prevent rabies and the need for public health actions to eliminate rabies-related deaths in Ghana. Further research and education on preventing animal bites and enhancing compliance with PEP are recommended to reduce the risk of human rabies.
