Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy influenced by factors like chronic hepatitis B and C viruses, smoking, and alcohol abuse. The progression of HCC involves genomic instability and gene alterations, with DNA repair enzymes playing a crucial role in maintaining genome integrity. XRCC1 gene polymorphisms have been studied in relation to HCC risk, with conflicting results. Studies have examined specific XRCC1 polymorphisms (Arg194Trp, Arg280His, and Arg399Gln) in various populations, finding mixed associations with HCC risk. Meta-analyses have shown no significant associations between these XRCC1 polymorphisms and HCC risk, with some studies reporting deviations from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of excluding certain studies, and no publication bias was found. Further research is needed to clarify the role of XRCC1 gene polymorphisms in HCC susceptibility, with a focus on larger, well-designed studies across diverse populations.
