The text discusses the importance of polynuclear coordination compounds, specifically [M6X8L6]2– clusters, in modern solid-state inorganic chemistry, focusing on their luminescent properties. Research has explored the electronic structure and spectroscopic properties of these clusters, revealing insights into their photophysics and photochemistry. Recent applications include using the luminescent [Mo6Cl14]2– cluster for tracking cancer cells, as an antiviral agent, bioimaging agent, and X-ray contrast media. Computational studies highlight the significance of axial pyridine ligands in the molecular orbitals of these clusters. The text details the synthesis of these clusters and their potential applications, such as chemical sensors for detecting explosives. Experimental methods involved various analytical techniques and equipment to study the luminescent properties and interactions with compounds like trinitrotoluene (TNT). The text also discusses fluorescence quenching behavior in the presence of nitroaromatic compounds, emphasizing the potential of molybdenum clusters as sensors for detecting explosives. Theoretical calculations show the involvement of TNT in the active lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals of the cluster-TNT complex, leading to luminescence deactivation. The study suggests the molybdenum cluster's potential as a sensing technology for detecting nitroaromatic explosives, although further research is needed for real-world applications and selectivity assessments.
