Eukaryotic transcription factors, such as the gut-enriched Krüppel-like factor (GKLF), are modular proteins with distinct domains for functions like DNA binding and transcription modulation. GKLF, primarily expressed in epithelial cells, is associated with growth arrest and inhibits DNA synthesis, suggesting a role as a negative regulator of cell growth. GKLF shares similarities with other Krüppel-like factors like EKLF, known for regulating the β-globin gene. GKLF has been shown to bind to specific DNA elements and interact with co-activators like p300/CBP, adding complexity to transcriptional regulation. Research on GKLF's transactivation mechanisms revealed the importance of specific acidic amino acid residues in its N-terminus for full activity. Mutations affecting these residues impacted GKLF's transactivation ability and interaction with CBP. GKLF's dual role as a repressor and activator in gene transcription was highlighted, with studies showing its involvement in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. The study also explored the intermolecular interactions between GKLF, E1A, and p300/CBP, indicating their roles in mediating GKLF's transactivating activity. The text emphasizes the significance of acidic residues in GKLF for its biological functions, including growth suppression. Overall, the research underscores the structural and functional complexity of GKLF and its involvement in various cellular processes through interactions with co-activators and specific DNA elements.
