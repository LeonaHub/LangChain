Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory condition affecting the skin and musculoskeletal system, leading to pain, functional limitations, and psychological effects. Lifestyle modifications, nonpharmacologic interventions, and psychological support are crucial for managing PsA and improving quality of life. Treatment guidelines recommend pharmacological therapies, but evidence on nonpharmacologic approaches is limited. A systematic review focused on nonpharmacologic interventions for PsA to enhance patient quality of life. Studies included lifestyle modifications, psychological interventions, and nonpharmacologic approaches. The review assessed outcomes based on patient-centered recommendations and disease activity measures. While exercise, diet, and smoking cessation may improve PsA outcomes, more high-quality research is needed to determine the impact of lifestyle interventions on PsA. The review highlighted challenges in assessing bias, synthesizing results, and establishing causal factors due to study heterogeneity and limitations. Despite known benefits of healthy lifestyles, evidence specific to PsA is lacking, making it difficult to recommend lifestyle changes confidently. The text emphasizes the importance of systematic research to evaluate the effectiveness of healthy lifestyle programs in PsA and guide future care improvements.
