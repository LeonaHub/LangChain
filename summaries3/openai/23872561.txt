The text discusses the production of antibiotics by Streptomyces bacteria, focusing on the regulation of antibiotic biosynthesis in Streptomyces lividans TK24. The study explores the role of the ppk gene in antibiotic overproduction by disrupting it, leading to increased antibiotic biosynthesis under phosphate limitation conditions. Proteomic analysis of wild-type and ppk mutant strains reveals differences in protein expression levels, particularly in enzymes related to glycolysis, fatty acid metabolism, and phosphate regulation. The study confirms a link between TAG degradation and antibiotic production, with the mutant strain showing increased TAG degradation and overproduction of antibiotics. The text emphasizes the importance of understanding the relationship between primary and secondary metabolism in Streptomyces for antibiotic discovery. It also discusses the potential for novel antibiotic discovery strategies based on insights into TAG metabolism and antibiotic biosynthesis pathways.
