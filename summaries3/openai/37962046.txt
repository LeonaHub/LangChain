Neurotensin (NTS) is a neuropeptide found in different body parts, playing roles in various physiological and pathological processes. NTS acts through receptors like NTSR1, NTSR2, and NTSR3, with NTSR2 being less understood. NTSR2 has been linked to various functions, including analgesia, fear regulation, and addiction. It is involved in signaling pathways, such as MAPK-ERK1/2, and may impact neurotransmitter release and neuronal circuits. NTSR2's role in diseases like schizophrenia and cancer is being explored. Studies have developed NTS analogues targeting NTS receptors for therapeutic purposes. NTSR2 is expressed in the brain, gastrointestinal tract, and tumors, influencing functions like pain regulation and tumor growth. Further research is needed to fully understand NTSR2's involvement in these processes. The text also discusses the potential of NTSR2 in various physiological and pathological conditions,
