Soybean is a valuable global crop used in various industries, but faces economic threats from microbial diseases like soybean rust and charcoal rot. Studies have focused on understanding the biology and genetics of pathogens causing these diseases, with biocontrol strategies showing promise. Compounds like phenazine and mesaconic acid from bacteria like Pseudomonas fluorescens have demonstrated antifungal activity against soybean pathogens. Similarly, compounds like truncatenolide and truncatenone isolated from the fungus C. truncatum in Argentina have shown phytotoxic and antifungal properties, inhibiting the growth of pathogens like M. phaseolina and C. nicotianae. Computational methods and bioassays were used to analyze the structures and activities of these compounds, highlighting their potential as biofungicides. Further research is needed to explore the structure-activity relationships and toxicities of these compounds for effective disease management in soybean cultivation.
