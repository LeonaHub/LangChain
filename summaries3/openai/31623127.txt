Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a radiation-free imaging technique introduced in 2005 that measures the magnetic moments of magnetic nanoparticles using an alternating magnetic field. MPI offers high temporal and spatial resolution, making it suitable for imaging the cardiovascular system and local perfusion. The technique relies on the nonlinear magnetization behavior of nanoparticles to generate higher harmonics of the excitation frequency, which are measured inductively. Commercially available MPI tracers like perimag速 and synomag-D速 offer superior magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS) signal intensities compared to Resovist速, a common tracer used in MPI studies. The synthesis of new magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) for MPI involves methods like coprecipitation and thermal decomposition, each with its own advantages and limitations. Multicore particles (MCP) are also used as MPI tracers, offering potential advantages in terms of biocompatibility and biodegradability. The ideal MPI tracer should be monodisperse, biocompatible, and biodegradable for in vivo use. The text discusses the synthesis, characterization, and evaluation of MCP 3 as an MPI tracer, highlighting its superior imaging properties compared to Resovist速. The study includes the optimization of reconstruction parameters, assessment of signal-to-noise ratio (SN
