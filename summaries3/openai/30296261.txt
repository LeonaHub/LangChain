Bumblebees are facing declines in abundance and distribution globally, with nearly half of North American species at low numbers, posing a threat to ecosystems due to their role as pollinators. Neonicotinoids, a class of pesticides, are systemic and can harm bumblebees when taken up by plants, impacting their populations. Studies have shown that chronic exposure to neonicotinoids affects bumblebee survival, with males being more susceptible due to their smaller size and limited detoxification resources. Research has focused on identifying detoxification genes in bumblebees and assessing their response to neonicotinoids. Studies have found that different castes of bumblebees have varying sensitivities to neonicotinoids, with queens and males showing reduced survival rates compared to workers. Gene expression analyses have revealed clothianidin-induced genes related to detoxification and other biological functions in bumblebees. Chronic exposure to neonicotinoids can alter gene expression, impacting immunity, reproduction, and other functions in bees. The findings emphasize the need to consider queen and male survival in assessing neonicotinoid risks to bumblebee populations. Studies have also highlighted the sub-lethal effects of neonicotinoids on bees and the importance of genomic approaches to understanding their impact on pollinator health. Efforts are underway to develop tools for measuring neonicotinoid exposure in the field and assessing sub-lethal effects on bee behavior and physiology.
