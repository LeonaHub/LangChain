Bladder cancer is a major health concern in Europe, particularly muscle-invasive bladder cancer, which has a high mortality risk. Radical cystectomy is the standard treatment, but new strategies like neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapies are being explored. Research is focused on developing predictive models and identifying molecular biomarkers to improve risk assessment and treatment selection. Survivin, a protein involved in cell cycle regulation, is being investigated as a potential biomarker. Molecular subtyping using markers like KRT5 and KRT20 has been established for categorizing tumors. ERBB2 and BIRC5 are genes associated with adverse outcomes in bladder cancer. Studies are evaluating the prognostic role of these markers in muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. The text discusses the correlation between various molecular markers, clinical variables, and patient outcomes. Combining markers like survivin and KRT20 mRNA may predict disease-specific survival. Macrophage infiltration is associated with tumor subtype and patient characteristics. The text also highlights the impact of ERBB2 overexpression and macrophage presence on patient survival. Studies suggest survivin as a potential predictive marker for chemotherapy benefit. The text discusses the use of immunohistochemistry and molecular methods in analyzing markers and their association
