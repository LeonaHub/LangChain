Medulloblastoma is a malignant pediatric brain tumor with distinct molecular subgroups, including WNT, SHH, Group 3, and Group 4, each with unique genetic features and clinical outcomes. Group 3 tumors, mainly found in pediatric patients, have a poor prognosis and limited treatment options, necessitating new therapeutic approaches. The Connectivity Map (C-MAP) database, a bioinformatic tool based on gene expression, was used to identify potential small molecule inhibitors for Group 3 medulloblastomas. Piperlongumine and alsterpaullone were highlighted as top candidates for treating Group 3 tumors, with alsterpaullone showing effectiveness in reversing the gene expression signature and downregulating cell cycle-related genes. In vitro and in vivo studies confirmed the efficacy of these compounds in reducing tumor growth and improving survival rates in mouse models of Group 3 medulloblastoma. The study also identified shared compounds between Group 3 and Group 4 tumors, emphasizing their genetic similarities. Alsterpaullone was found to target CDKs, leading to growth inhibition and apoptosis in Group 3 medulloblastoma cell lines. The study highlights the potential of chemical genomics in identifying targeted therapies for specific medulloblastoma subgroups and the importance of targeting cell cycle-related genes in MYC-dependent tumors like Group 3 medulloblastomas. Further research will focus on characterizing CDK regulation in Group 3 medulloblastoma to enhance targeted therapies.
