The text discusses the challenges of global food security due to increased food demand by 2050, declining arable land, and crop losses from climate change-induced flooding. It emphasizes the importance of flood-tolerant crops and the role of ethylene in enhancing hypoxia tolerance in plants. The study explores how ethylene signaling influences hypoxia responses in various Solanum species, including potato, bittersweet, tomato, and eggplant, to improve flooding tolerance. Results show that ethylene enhances hypoxia responses in some species, leading to increased survival and biomass retention during hypoxia. The study also investigates the transcriptional hypoxia response in different plant tissues and the variability in gene expression and protein levels under stress conditions. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms of ethylene-mediated hypoxia acclimation and its impact on flooding tolerance in vegetable crops. The study utilized various plant materials and experimental setups to analyze gene expression and signaling pathways related to flooding and hypoxia tolerance. Different statistical tests were employed to analyze the data and draw conclusions from the study results.
