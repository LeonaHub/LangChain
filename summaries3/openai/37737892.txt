Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is caused by an RNA virus from the Hepeviridae family, with genotypes 1 and 2 transmitted fecal-orally and genotypes 3 and 4 commonly transmitted through undercooked pork and wild boar meat in Europe and North America. In Germany, there has been an increase in reported HEV cases, with an estimated large number of unreported cases. HEV infection is usually asymptomatic, with mild symptoms, but a small percentage of patients develop jaundice. Neurological symptoms are common extrahepatic manifestations, with unclear pathomechanisms. Diagnosis involves testing for anti-HEV-IgM, anti-HEV-IgG, and HEV-RNA, with treatment options including ribavirin in severe cases. Studies have explored the association between HEV infection and various neurological conditions, finding a probable link in some cases. The presence of anti-HEV antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid may help evaluate pathomechanisms in patients with neurological symptoms. Further research is needed to understand the relationship between HEV infection and neurological manifestations, with considerations for regional differences in seroprevalence and genotypes. The study suggests that HEV should be considered in patients with unexplained neurological symptoms, particularly in cases of neuralgic amyotrophy/plexus neuritis.
