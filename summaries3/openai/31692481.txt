Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumor in adults, classified into subgroups and graded by WHO tumor grade. High-grade gliomas (WHO grade III-IV) are considered incurable, with limited long-term survivors. Patients often experience acute or subacute neurologic symptoms leading to diagnosis. Treatment involves surgery, radiotherapy, and/or chemotherapy, aiming to extend life but can have short- and long-term effects on symptoms and health-related quality of life. Clinical trials now incorporate patient-centered outcomes to assess treatment impact on patient function and quality of life. Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures are utilized in clinical trials to assess the impact of treatment on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in high-grade glioma patients. Challenges in using PRO measures include missing data, patient's ability to self-report, and selection bias. Symptom management is crucial in survivorship care for high-grade glioma patients, involving the identification, prevention, and treatment of symptoms, side effects, and psychological issues. Integrating PROs into clinical practice faces challenges but is beneficial for improving patient-provider communication, symptom control, and patient satisfaction. The text emphasizes the importance of maintaining or improving neurologic function and HRQoL in high-grade glioma patients. The use of PRO measures alongside traditional outcome measures is essential in neuro-oncology research and survivorship care. Efforts are being made to use a combination of different outcome measures, including PRO measures, to enhance patient care and outcomes.
