Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a condition that can develop after exposure to distressful life events involving terror, fear, and helplessness. It is characterized by symptoms such as intrusive recollections, hyperarousal, avoidant behavior, and changes in cognitive and emotional responses. The prevalence of PTSD varies globally, with studies showing rates ranging from 11.8% to 54% in East Africa and 3.6% to 88% in internally displaced populations. In Ethiopia, the prevalence of PTSD ranges from 15.4% to 85%. Factors associated with PTSD include being female, having other mental illnesses, multiple exposures, and poor social support. A meta-analysis and systematic review in Ethiopia found a prevalence of PTSD among adults to be 39.28% with a sample size of 5874. Poor social support, being female, and having a previous mental illness were identified as significant predictors of PTSD. Immediate intervention and social support are crucial in preventing and managing PTSD, especially for individuals with a history of mental illness and those who have witnessed traumatic events.
