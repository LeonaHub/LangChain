Haldane's Rule states that in hybrid offspring of different animal races, the absent, rare, or sterile sex is always the heterozygous sex, with greater fitness reductions in hybrid females in birds with a ZW sex determination system. The rule is often explained through dominance theory, specifically the Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility model, which suggests interactions between incompatible alleles at multiple genetic loci. Studies in birds have shown faster evolution of genes on the Z-chromosome, attributed to genetic drift and the fixation of non-dominant beneficial alleles. Research has focused on introgression rates of different genetic loci in hybrid birds, with most studies supporting Haldane's Rule. However, exceptions exist, such as higher introgression rates for mitochondrial loci in mallard and spot-billed duck hybrids due to asymmetrical mating patterns. Ancient introgression of mitochondrial DNA in avian species has been attributed to factors like selective sweep and genetic drift. Genomic studies have been limited, with a recent focus on identifying barrier loci related to reproductive isolation rather than estimating introgression rates. Future studies could explore how introgression rates in specific genomic regions relate to fitness components to gain insights into the genetic mechanisms behind Haldane's Rule. New sequencing technologies offer promising research opportunities to study the W-chromosome and its connection to genetic incompatibilities between species.
