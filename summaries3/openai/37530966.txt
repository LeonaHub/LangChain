The text discusses the impact of radiation on vascular endothelial cells in sensitive organs, such as the bone marrow and gastrointestinal tract, leading to specific changes like inflammation, altered gene expression, and decreased barrier function. It explores the concept of delayed effects of acute radiation exposure (DEARE), which can result in long-term health issues like inflammatory and fibrotic conditions. The text introduces the potential role of Delta-like ligand 4 (Dll4) in mediating radiation-induced alterations in vascular structure and function, with studies showing that reducing Dll4 expression may improve outcomes in radiation-induced endothelial dysfunction. Research using rat models with varying Dll4 expression levels demonstrates that Dll4-low rats exhibit improved survival and protection against vascular injury post-radiation compared to Dll4-high rats. The text also discusses the use of near-infrared (NIR) imaging techniques, such as 2nd window NIR imaging with Indocyanine Green (ICG), to track changes in vascular permeability in organs like the lungs and kidneys non-invasively. Studies show that rats with lower Dll4 expression have reduced susceptibility to radiation-induced vascular damage and improved survival outcomes. Additionally, the text highlights the potential of ICG imaging for assessing vascular injury in response to radiation, particularly in detecting glomerulus disruption in the kidneys. Overall, the text emphasizes the importance of Dll4 in vascular dysfunction post-radiation and the potential for targeting Dll4 as a therapeutic strategy for mitigating radiation-induced vascular remodeling.
