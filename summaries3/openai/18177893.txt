The text discusses the role of cadmium-responsive genes, specifically cdr-1, cdr-4, and cdr-6, in C. elegans. These genes are involved in detoxification and defense against cadmium toxicity. Studies have identified their expression patterns, regulatory pathways, and structural similarities. Various methods, such as RNA interference and transgenic techniques, were used to study the functions of these genes. The text also explores the impact of different stressors on gene expression, including metal exposure and osmotic stress. Additionally, it delves into the regulatory elements in the promoters of cdr genes and their comparison with other stress-responsive genes. The study highlights the importance of GATA elements in regulating cell-specific transcription in C. elegans. Furthermore, the text discusses the potential redundancy in biological functions among CDR proteins and their regulation at the transcriptional level. The findings suggest that CDR proteins play crucial roles in cellular processes, such as osmoregulation and detoxification, in C. elegans.
