Rubella, also known as German measles, was initially considered mild but was later found to cause birth defects in newborns when contracted by pregnant women, leading to the identification of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). The rubella vaccine was developed in 1970 to combat the virus, which typically presents with symptoms like fever, malaise, and rash. Rubella infections can lead to complications such as arthralgia and chronic arthritis, with the most severe consequences occurring when the virus infects the fetus, potentially causing miscarriage or CRS. Despite the availability of a safe vaccine, rubella infections remain a leading cause of preventable congenital birth defects globally. Vaccination, particularly the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, is recommended by the WHO to maintain high coverage rates and prevent outbreaks. Studies in Italy have focused on rubella seroprevalence, vaccination coverage, and the success of vaccination campaigns in preventing CRS. The research emphasizes the importance of administering two doses of the rubella vaccine to ensure high seroprevalence rates and prevent the disease. Communication strategies and targeted efforts towards unvaccinated individuals, especially adolescents, are suggested to improve overall immunity levels. Maintaining high vaccination coverage is crucial to prevent rubella and
