The text discusses the complex composition of tooth dentin, including its structural elements and the influence of internal structure, composition, and external factors on its mechanical properties. Various techniques, such as micro- and nano-indentation, are used to study dentin hardness, with studies aiming to improve precision and accuracy in measurements. The BioDent RPI technique is highlighted for its consistency and reproducibility in dentin microhardness analysis. The study compared dentin hardness using BioDent RPI and traditional Knoop hardness tests, finding a decrease in hardness from superficial to deep dentin. Micro-Raman spectroscopy revealed differences in dentin composition by location, with superficial dentin having more mineral content and deep dentin having more organic matrix and carbonate content. The study also found a positive relationship between dentin hardness and mineral content, and a negative relationship with carbonate content, indicating decreased mineral crystallinity. These findings suggest that dentin is a gradient biocomposite material with varying mechanical properties and microstructure by location.
