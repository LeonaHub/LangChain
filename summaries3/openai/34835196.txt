The text discusses the Infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV) infections in fish, particularly Chinese perch, causing economic losses. Vaccination is crucial due to the lack of effective antiviral treatments. The development of a double-antibody sandwich ELISA method to measure the major capsid protein (MCP) antigen concentration in inactivated ISKNV vaccines is detailed. Mouse monoclonal antibodies were generated for this purpose, and the ELISA method was found to be sensitive, accurate, and convenient. The study involved virus purification, monoclonal antibody production, and characterization of the MCP antigen. The ELISA method was validated for detecting the MCP antigen concentration in vaccines, showing a positive correlation with viral titers. Monoclonal antibodies were used for epitope analysis and characterization, with the study emphasizing the importance of the MCP in vaccine development. The ELISA method was highlighted as a sensitive and specific tool for assessing antigen quality in inactivated ISKNV vaccines.
