Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inherited disorder caused by mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene, leading to varying levels of enzyme activity. Over 900 mutations have been identified in the PAH gene, affecting the structure and function of the enzyme. Studies have shown correlations between specific mutations and disease severity, with genotype primarily determining the metabolic phenotype. Research has focused on understanding how mutations impact PKU phenotypes, particularly in European and Chinese populations. Different genotypes have been associated with classic PKU, mild PKU, and mild hyperphenylalaninemia (MHP). The text highlights the importance of genotype-phenotype correlations in predicting disease severity and guiding treatment. Various mutations have been identified in the PAH gene, with some mutations consistently associated with classic PKU. The text discusses the impact of mutations on enzyme activity and the classification of patients based on their genotypes and phenotypes. Studies have shown inconsistencies in phenotype expression among patients with the same mutations, suggesting the influence of modifier genes and environmental factors. Further research is needed to better understand the complex relationships between genotypes and phenotypes in PKU.
