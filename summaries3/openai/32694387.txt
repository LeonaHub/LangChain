The text discusses the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) definition of pain, which was recommended in 1978 and has been widely accepted globally. The definition describes pain as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage. However, there have been calls for a re-evaluation of the definition due to advances in understanding pain. A task force was formed in 2018 to evaluate the definition, leading to a revised recommendation that was unanimously accepted by the IASP Council. Critics have raised concerns about the definition, stating that it neglects ethical dimensions and fails to address pain in vulnerable populations. The task force incorporated feedback from the global pain community to refine the definition, emphasizing the subjective nature of pain influenced by biological, psychological, and social factors. The revised definition highlights pain as an aversive sensory and emotional experience caused by actual or potential tissue injury. The text also discusses the distinction between pain and nociception, the complexity of chronic pain, and the inclusion of nociplastic pain syndromes in the definition. The IASP's efforts to update the classification of pain diseases and align with ontological frameworks for understanding pain are also highlighted.
