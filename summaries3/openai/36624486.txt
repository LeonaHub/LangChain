Dementia is a global health concern with no cure, but understanding risk factors like physical function can aid in prevention. Studies suggest a link between brisk walking pace and lower dementia risk, as well as lower grip strength and higher dementia risk. Combining walking pace and grip strength may provide a stronger association with health outcomes. Factors like age, genetics, and lifestyle influence the relationship between walking pace, grip strength, and dementia risk. A study using UK Biobank data found brisk walking pace and higher grip strength were associated with a lower risk of new-onset dementia. The study highlighted the impact of factors like APOE Îµ4 allele and age on this relationship. While limitations exist, self-perceived walking pace shows promise as a dementia risk factor. Understanding the combined influence of physical function, genetics, and age is crucial for identifying individuals at risk of dementia.
