Pecans are a significant crop in the southeastern United States, particularly in Georgia, which is a major producer of pecans. Pecan scab, caused by the fungus Venturia effusa, is a common disease in pecan trees in the region. The disease is polycyclic, with multiple generations per year, and overwinters as lesions on twigs and shucks within the tree canopy. Managing pecan scab is challenging, with planting resistant cultivars and frequent fungicide use being common methods. Demethylation-inhibiting (DMI) fungicides are widely used to control plant diseases, but resistance in fungi has been reported since the 1980s. Studies have shown decreased sensitivity of V. effusa to certain DMI fungicides over time, with reports of field resistance to tebuconazole. The resistance is typically due to changes in the CYP51 gene, overexpression of the gene, or efflux pumps reducing fungicide accumulation within the pathogen. Research has identified novel mutations in the CYP51A and B genes, as well as increased expression of these genes, as mechanisms for resistance to fungicidal compounds in V. effusa. The study evaluated the field sensitivity of V. effusa to DMI fungicides in pecan orchards in Georgia and found that newer DMI fungicides like mefentrifluconazole and difenoconazole were effective against scab, while older DMI fungicides were becoming ineffective due to resistance development. Understanding the mechanism of resistance can help in developing detection methods to identify and track specific resistance
