The text extensively covers the concept of the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) as a crucial metric for evaluating the market competitiveness of various energy sources, particularly focusing on emerging technologies like halide perovskites in the solar energy sector. It discusses the challenges and advancements in scaling up the fabrication process of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), emphasizing factors such as stability, efficiency, and manufacturing costs. The text also addresses the importance of accurately assessing the stability of PSCs, as degradation rates significantly impact LCOE predictions. Furthermore, it highlights the need for refining models to calculate LCOE more accurately by determining missing input variables like outdoor performance and stability. The text suggests that perovskite photovoltaics are moving towards industrialization from a research phase, with a focus on reducing LCOE to make them competitive in the market. Strategies to achieve this goal include reducing manufacturing costs through alternative materials and production methods.
