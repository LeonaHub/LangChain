Macroalgae are aquatic plants that produce polysaccharides like carrageenan, agars, and alginates, with brown macroalgae containing fucose sulphated polysaccharides (FSPs) and glucans. These compounds have various beneficial properties, making them attractive for food, cosmetic, pharmaceutical, and biomedical applications. The extraction of polysaccharides from macroalgae is influenced by factors like species, parts of the algae, and extraction methods. Innovative technologies like Hydrothermal-Assisted Extraction (HAE) are being explored to improve extraction efficiency and yield. Studies have optimized extraction conditions for polysaccharides and antioxidant activities from macroalgae, with a focus on Laminaria hyperborea. The chemical structure and biological activities of FSPs and glucans vary based on extraction parameters and species. Different extraction methods, including ultrasound and thermal technologies, have been used to recover polysaccharides from macroalgae, with varying results depending on the species. Further research is needed to fully characterize and purify the extracted compounds for potential biorefinery applications.
