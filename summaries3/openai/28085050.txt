Alzheimer's disease is a degenerative brain disease and the leading cause of dementia, with significant public health implications. The cause of Alzheimer's disease is complex and likely influenced by genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Studies have identified the MTHFR gene as a candidate gene associated with Alzheimer's disease and other neurological conditions. Mutations in the MTHFR gene can lead to hyperhomocysteinemia, increasing the risk of neurological disorders like Alzheimer's disease. Chronic air pollution exposure may contribute to the development of neurodegenerative disorders through inflammation and increased homocysteine levels. A study aimed to investigate the relationship between MTHFR polymorphisms and Alzheimer's disease in the context of gene-environment interaction, particularly focusing on the impact of air pollution. The study utilized big data analytic techniques to analyze the association between MTHFR polymorphisms and Alzheimer's disease risk. The results showed varying frequencies of MTHFR genotypes across different populations, with the TT and CT genotypes of the MTHFR C677T gene associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. The study also explored the interaction between gene mutations, air pollution, and Alzheimer's disease risks. The findings suggest that the MTHFR C677T polymorphism is linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, potentially influenced by exposure to environmental toxins from air pollution. Further research is needed to understand
