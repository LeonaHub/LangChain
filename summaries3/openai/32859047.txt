The text discusses the role of the gut microbiota in cardiovascular health and disease, particularly focusing on the metabolites produced by gut bacteria and their impact on cardiovascular conditions like heart failure. It highlights the association between trimethylamine (TMA) and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) levels in the blood with cardiovascular diseases, suggesting that elevated TMAO levels are linked to poor prognosis in heart failure patients. The study involved comparing cardiovascular parameters, TMA, and TMAO levels in Wistar Kyoto rats and spontaneously hypertensive heart failure (SHHF) rats. Results showed that SHHF rats with heart failure had higher levels of TMA and TMAO in plasma and urine, indicating increased gut-to-blood permeability. The study also found structural and functional disturbances in the intestinal wall of SHHF rats, affecting factors like intestinal blood flow, mucosa thickness, and tight junction proteins. The text discusses the methodology used in the study, including metabolic and hemodynamic measurements, histopathological evaluations, RNA isolation, RT-qPCR, protein extraction, and immunoblotting analysis. It also describes the laboratory procedures for analyzing protein concentrations, Western blot techniques, and data analysis methods. Additionally, the text outlines the statistical analyses performed on various parameters to compare differences between groups.
