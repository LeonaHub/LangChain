Chronic cranial windows have been instrumental in advancing in vivo optical imaging studies by enabling long-term, high-resolution imaging in various brain regions, particularly in small animals like mice. These windows allow for multiple imaging techniques on a single specimen over extended periods, exceeding 1 year. The text discusses the use of behavioral training, external stimuli, and data collection techniques to study neural activity in animals, utilizing methods such as in vivo electrical recording and two-photon imaging combined with electrophysiology. Direct physical access to the brain through acute craniotomies has been crucial for validating observations made in vitro and for various imaging and manipulation techniques, although these experiments are typically terminal. Techniques combining chronic imaging with direct cellular recording or manipulation require sophisticated surgeries and window designs, mainly applied in larger mammals but not in mice due to their size. A new device has been developed to combine chronic imaging with easy physical access to the brain, allowing for multiple cellular manipulations over an extended period after an initial surgery. The device simplifies the surgical procedure, maintains imaging quality and stability, and enables various activities such as drug delivery, sample extractions, and electrophysiological recording while ensuring the health of the animal and preventing contamination of the brain. The text details the fabrication process of the device, including the use of different types of silicone for creating access ports and the surgical procedures involved in attaching
