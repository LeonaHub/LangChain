Protein homeostasis is crucial for human health, with protein ubiquitination being a key mechanism in regulating protein levels and cellular processes. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), particularly the ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs), play a significant role in various biological processes and disease pathways. USP21, a member of the USP subfamily, has been linked to promoting tumor growth in different cancers. Developing tool compounds to target DUBs like USP21 is essential for advancing potential therapeutic strategies. A recent study identified a highly potent and selective inhibitor, BAY-805, for USP21, aiming to investigate its cellular function and potential as a therapeutic cancer target. The study involved screening millions of compounds to identify small molecules inhibiting USP21, leading to the discovery of compound 21 as a potent USP21 inhibitor with high selectivity and the ability to enhance the NF-ÎºB pathway. Compound 21 demonstrated strong cellular activity and selectivity within the DUB target family and against various off-targets, making it a valuable chemical probe for further research into the biological pathways of USP21.
