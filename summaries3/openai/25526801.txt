A thrombin inhibitor derived from leeches, known as hirudin, has been extensively studied for its ability to irreversibly inactivate thrombin. The inhibitor, a small peptide, binds to active thrombin and has been modified to enhance its interaction with thrombin. Recombinant versions of hirudin, such as RGD-hirudin, have been developed and studied for their anti-thrombin and anti-platelet aggregation activities. Molecular modeling and docking simulations have been used to analyze the interaction between RGD-hirudin and thrombin, identifying specific residues crucial for binding. Mutagenesis studies have confirmed the importance of certain residues in the interaction and highlighted the significance of negatively charged residues in the C-terminus. The study suggests that both the N-terminus and C-terminus of RGD-hirudin are essential for inhibiting thrombin activity and forming hydrogen bonds with thrombin. Surface plasmon resonance analysis has shown that mutations in specific residues weaken the binding affinity of RGD-hirudin with thrombin. The research aims to develop new oral antithrombin peptides for combating thrombotic diseases by understanding the molecular interactions between RGD-hirudin and thrombin.
