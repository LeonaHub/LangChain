Large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia encompasses T-cell LGL leukemia and aggressive NK-cell leukemia, both characterized by cytotoxic lymphocytes. The 2008 World Health classification distinguishes between these based on molecular and clinical features. A new entity, chronic lymphoproliferative disorder of NK cells, has been identified to differentiate from aggressive NK-cell leukemia. FTY720, an immunomodulatory drug, has shown efficacy in hematologic malignancies by acting on sphingosine 1 phosphate receptors. In NK-cell leukemia, FTY720 induces apoptosis by degrading Mcl-1 through a lysosomal pathway. Studies involved patient samples, cell lines, and animal models, demonstrating FTY720's ability to induce apoptosis in leukemic NK cells through Mcl-1 degradation and altered sphingolipid metabolism. FTY720 treatment in a rat model of NK-cell leukemia led to remission by reducing leukemic cell infiltration and targeting Mcl-1. The text also discusses the role of lysosomes, cathepsins, and sphingolipids in FTY720-induced apoptosis, highlighting potential combined therapies for NK-cell leukemia.
