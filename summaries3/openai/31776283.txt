Interferons are classified into three families: type I (IFN-α/β), type II (IFN-γ), and type III (IFN-λ). Type I and type III IFNs are crucial in innate immunity against viral infections, with humans having four type III IFN genes. The IFNL4 gene, discovered through genetic data and RNA sequencing analysis, shows low DNA sequence similarity with other IFNL genes and is conserved among mammals except for rodents. The IFNL4-TT allele, a frameshift mutation, has become the major allele in humans due to positive selection, affecting HCV clearance rates and treatment response. Despite showing antiviral activity in lab settings, IFN-λ4's impact on lower HCV clearance rates is linked to a specific amino acid substitution. Studies suggest that the IFNL4 gene may function differently in vivo compared to other type III interferons, acting in a proviral and anti-inflammatory manner. The IFNL4 promoter may be nonfunctional in humans, indicating a trend in human evolution to suppress IFN-λ4 expression. The text discusses the unique properties of the IFNL4 gene, its regulation, and its potential role in liver fibrosis and inflammation. Experiments reveal that the IFNL4 promoter is evolutionarily and functionally distinct from canonical IFN promoters like IFNL1. The study explores the regulation of IFNL4 and IFNL1 promoters, highlighting the differences in their responsiveness to viral infection. The text also discusses the low expression of IFNL4 mRNA in certain cells and the challenges in identifying the stimulus for its induction. The study suggests that the IFNL4 gene is a noncanonical member of the type III IFN family with unique regulatory mechanisms.
