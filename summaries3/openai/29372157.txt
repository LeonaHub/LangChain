Endometriosis is a common condition affecting women in their reproductive years, with ovarian endometriosis being a prevalent manifestation. Surgical treatment, particularly laparoscopic stripping of cyst walls, is recommended for larger ovarian endometriomas to reduce relapse rates and improve fertility. Recurrent endometriomas are a common issue with challenging management, as there are no specific guidelines for treatment. Surgical re-intervention for recurrent endometrioma should be a last resort due to potential harm to ovarian function and reserve. Dienogest is considered a safe and effective long-term medical therapy for preventing endometrioma recurrence post-surgery, with minimal side effects and high compliance rates. Studies have shown low recurrence rates with dienogest therapy, making it a preferred option over other medications. Patients generally tolerate dienogest well, with irregular bleeding being a common side effect. Further research is needed to determine the maximum age for long-term dienogest therapy and its effectiveness in preventing recurrence. Meticulous surgical techniques and post-operative prophylactic measures are crucial in reducing recurrence rates and preserving ovarian function.
