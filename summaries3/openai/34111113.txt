Frozen shoulder, also known as adhesive capsulitis, is a condition characterized by shoulder pain and reduced range of movement, affecting a small percentage of the population typically between 40 and 60 years old. The causes of frozen shoulder are not well understood, but diabetes is a significant risk factor. Genome-wide association studies and Mendelian randomization analyses have been used to investigate the biological mechanisms and potential drug targets for frozen shoulder. Studies have identified genetic variants associated with frozen shoulder, with a focus on genes like WNT7B, MMP14, and SFRP4. Diabetes, particularly Type 1 diabetes, has been found to be causally linked to an increased risk of frozen shoulder, with individuals with longer diabetes duration and poor glycemic control at higher risk. The overlap in genetic signals between frozen shoulder and Dupuytren's disease, both involving the WNT pathway, suggests a potential correlation. However, there are limitations to the studies, including reliance on hospital-coded diagnoses and the need for further research in diverse populations. Overall, the findings provide valuable insights into the understanding and potential treatment of frozen shoulder.
