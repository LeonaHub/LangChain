The text discusses how infections in the root canal system can lead to inflammatory periapical lesions (IPLs) such as periapical granulomas (PG) and periapical cysts (PC). PGs are characterized by chronic inflammation, while PCs consist of cystic cavities lined by stratified squamous epithelium. The study aimed to evaluate the expression of various proteins in PGs and PCs at different stages of IPL development. The methodology involved histological and immunohistochemical analyses of 52 IPLs, with findings indicating that EGF and KGF expression may influence the development of IPLs. CD57+ cells were more common in IPLs with moderate/intense inflammatory infiltrates. The study also found that Ki-67 expression in the epithelial lining of PCs was limited, with greater expression in PCs with intense inflammatory infiltrates. The study concluded that increased EGF and KGF expression in PCs, along with the presence of CD57+ cells in lesions with intense inflammatory infiltrates, may influence the development of IPLs.
