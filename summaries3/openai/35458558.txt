The text discusses the origin and transmission of zoonotic respiratory diseases caused by Beta-coronaviruses, focusing on SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. It highlights the search for non-human sources and intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2, with bats and pangolins considered potential reservoirs. The entry process of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells through the ACE2 receptor is detailed, along with the role of cellular proteases like TMPRSS2 and CTSL. Studies on mRNA expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL in various animal species' respiratory tracts are discussed, revealing differences in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The text describes experimental infection studies on different animal species, including dogs, ferrets, and cattle, to assess viral replication and cytopathic effects. It also mentions the importance of primary cell culture models for studying SARS-CoV-2 and the need to identify potential host species while minimizing animal experimentation. The text emphasizes the role of ACE2 in determining susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, with studies indicating that dogs can support viral replication despite low ACE2 expression in lung tissue. Additionally, it discusses the use of alternative receptors for viral entry and the varying susceptibility of animal species like hamsters and ferrets to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The text underscores the importance of further research to understand the transmission dynamics and potential reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2.
