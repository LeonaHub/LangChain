The text extensively discusses autoimmune diseases, focusing on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as an example. It explains how autoimmune diseases occur when the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's tissues, leading to chronic inflammation and damage. In RA, synovial fibroblasts play a crucial role in causing inflammation and tissue destruction in the joints. The lack of available cures for autoimmune diseases and the increasing global prevalence of these conditions are highlighted. Treatments for RA mainly target inflammation, with NSAIDs like ibuprofen commonly prescribed, but they can have side effects. Patients often seek alternative therapies like dietary supplements such as fish oil, ginger, and green tea, which have been found to improve the pathological condition of RA. Green tea, rich in EGCG, is particularly highlighted for its potential anti-inflammatory effects in RA. Studies have shown that EGCG, EGC, and EC, compounds found in green tea, have varying effects on inhibiting inflammation in human RASFs, with EGCG being the most effective. The text also delves into the molecular mechanisms of how these catechins interact with proteins involved in the inflammatory pathways, such as TAK1. It discusses the importance of the galloyl moiety in EGCG for its superior anti-inflammatory properties compared to EGC and EC. Additionally, the pharmacokinetics of catechins in humans, particularly EGCG, EGC, and EC, are explored, with varying levels detected in plasma and urine post-administration. The text emphasizes the need for further research to optimize the use of green tea as a dietary supplement for inflammatory conditions like RA, considering factors such as catechin and drug interactions,
