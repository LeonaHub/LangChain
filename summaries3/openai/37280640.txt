The text discusses the implementation and impact of mandatory calorie labeling in the out-of-home food sector (OHFS) in the UK. It highlights concerns about the energy density of OHFS food, consumer underestimation of calorie content, and the potential link to poor diet quality and obesity. The UK government introduced mandatory calorie labeling for large food businesses in England in 2021 to address these issues. Research studies examined calorie labeling practices, customer behavior, and awareness before and after the policy implementation. Findings showed low compliance with labeling, high calorie purchases, underestimation of calories, and limited impact of labeling on consumer choices. Factors influencing calorie purchases included age, gender, outlet type, and location. The text suggests that mandatory calorie labeling could help reduce calorie consumption and promote healthier choices, but challenges such as low awareness and understanding of labeling remain. Future research is needed to assess the policy's effectiveness on consumer behavior and public health.
