Neutrophils play a crucial role in the immune response by defending against infections, and their timely removal from inflammation sites is essential for resolving inflammation. Factors such as bacterial phagocytosis and bacterial products can influence whether neutrophils undergo apoptosis or necrosis, impacting the outcome of the immune response. Studies have shown that neutrophils from uremic patients undergo accelerated apoptosis, but uremic plasma from dialysis patients can accelerate apoptosis in healthy donor neutrophils. The text discusses a study that evaluated neutrophil apoptosis in chronic kidney disease and hemodialysis patients, highlighting increased neutrophil activation in these patients and the impact of GM-CSF on neutrophil apoptosis and viability. Chronic low-grade inflammation is common in these patients due to various factors, including uremia, volume overload, and the dialysis procedure itself. Neutrophils in CKD and HD patients have significantly higher rates of apoptosis compared to controls, with CKD patients showing even higher rates than HD patients. The presence of toxic uremic solutes in CKD patients may accelerate neutrophil apoptosis, contributing to the increased risk of secondary infections. Studies have shown that GM-CSF can prevent neutrophil apoptosis, suggesting it could be beneficial in reducing neutrophil apoptosis and improving cell survival in patients with kidney disease. Further research is needed to understand how GM-CSF affects reducing neutrophil apoptosis and enhancing resistance to infections at a clinically significant level.
