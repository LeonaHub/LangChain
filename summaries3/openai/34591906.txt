The text discusses the increasing trend of pet ownership in South Korea and its impact on human health and well-being. It highlights the growth of the pet industry in the country and the positive effects of companion animals on their owners. The "companion animal effect" theory suggests that owning pets can have beneficial effects on physical, mental, and social health, supported by various studies. However, research on the relationship between pet ownership and health outcomes has produced conflicting results. Some studies suggest benefits such as reduced doctor visits, while others indicate potential risks like zoonosis and allergies. Studies have shown that pet ownership may not significantly impact children's health, and some populations, like pet owners in Sweden, may have higher rates of mental health issues. The text describes a study conducted in Seoul, South Korea, that aimed to investigate the relationship between owning companion animals and life satisfaction. The study found that pet owners generally reported higher levels of overall life satisfaction compared to non-owners. Factors such as demographics, education, income, and the number of pets owned were found to influence satisfaction levels. The study used statistical analysis techniques to explore the relationship between pet ownership and life satisfaction, finding a positive association between owning pets and overall life satisfaction. The study also analyzed the impact of the number and type of pets owned on life satisfaction, with results showing that individuals who owned both dogs and cats had the highest life satisfaction scores. The text suggests that future research should consider cultural differences and use longitudinal study designs to provide more accurate comparisons.
