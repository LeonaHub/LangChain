Tandem repeats (TRs) are DNA sequence motifs with adjacent repeating units found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, categorized into microsatellites and minisatellites. Short tandem repeats (SSRs) are widely detected in plants, animals, and arthropods, with varying motifs in different species. TRs are mutable and associated with diseases in humans and detrimental phenotypes in plants. Studies have shown no significant correlation between genome size and TR density in plants and animals. TRs are nonrandomly distributed in genomes, often found within genes and regulatory regions. Different species exhibit unique patterns of TR distribution and motif frequencies. TRs play roles in gene regulation, with potential impacts on transcription and translation processes. GC content influences the nucleotide content of TR motifs, with variations observed among different species. TR motifs are prevalent in different regions of genetic sequences, with potential roles in gene expression and regulation. The distribution of TRs in intragenic and intergenic regions shows biases towards gene ends in dicots and monocots. TRs in introns may be involved in regulatory processes, including splicing. Advances in sequencing technologies are enhancing our understanding of TRs and their regulatory roles in plant and green algal genomes. Further research is needed to explore the characteristics, functions, and evolutionary patterns of TRs in different organisms.
