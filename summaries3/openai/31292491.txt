Ependymoma (EPN) is a malignant brain tumor that primarily affects children, commonly found in the posterior fossa. Recent research has highlighted the genetic heterogeneity within EPNs, impacting tumor behavior and prognosis. Traditional therapies like surgery and radiation have limitations, with chemotherapy showing limited effectiveness. Amblyomin-X, a potential therapeutic agent, has shown promise due to its anticoagulant, antiangiogenic, and antitumor properties. Studies have demonstrated its cytotoxic effects on EPN cells, inducing apoptosis selectively in tumor cells. Amblyomin-X has shown superior results compared to current treatments like temozolomide and cisplatin. Preclinical evidence suggests its effectiveness in inducing cell death through various cellular alterations. In vivo studies using xenograft models have shown significant tumor regression with Amblyomin-X treatment, as confirmed by imaging techniques and histological analysis. Further research is needed to understand the molecular subtypes of EPN and improve prognostic assessments. Studies have also explored the effects of Amblyomin-X on normal cells, showing selective action on tumor cells with low toxicity to normal cells. The compound's potential as an anticancer agent is supported by its ability to induce apoptosis and target tumor cells effectively.
