The text emphasizes the significance of energy-saving and environmentally friendly industries, particularly in the context of lightweight high-speed vehicles. It discusses the challenges of welding T-joints in high-strength steel sandwich panels, focusing on the limitations of laser welding methods. The flux bands constricting arc (FBCA) welding method is proposed as a solution for manufacturing these panels, with a detailed exploration of its impact on arc behavior and metal transfer characteristics. Various innovative systems and methods are developed to improve welding processes in narrow gaps, aiming to enhance efficiency and quality control. The text also delves into the experimental setup, process parameters, and results of FBCA welding experiments using high-strength steel for marine sandwich panels. It highlights the impact of flux bands on arc behavior, heat distribution, and penetration in T-joint welding, as well as the influence of groove gaps on metal transfer characteristics. The study concludes that flux bands enhance arc stability, reduce voltage and current fluctuations, and improve the overall welding process in ultra-narrow gaps.
