Renal cell carcinoma is a common and deadly urological tumor with various risk factors, including smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and genetics. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can serve as genetic markers for identifying genes involved in renal cancer development. A study investigated the MAGE-A11 gene's role in renal cell carcinoma by analyzing two common SNPs. The research included case-control and cohort studies, analyzing genetic variants' associations with RCC risk and survival. Specific genetic variations in MAGE-A11, rs6641352, and rs6540341, were linked to RCC risk, with the rs6641352 genotype impacting RCC survival. The study used statistical methods to analyze RCC patient survival, genetic associations, and demographic characteristics. The research identified potential genetic susceptibility factors for RCC, highlighting the importance of intronic SNPs in tumor formation. Further research is needed to validate these findings and understand the mechanisms underlying these genetic variations in RCC development and prognosis.
