The text discusses how surface texture, influenced by manufacturing processes, impacts the functional properties of machined elements. The introduction of three-dimensional measurement has improved surface topography analysis, particularly through areal surface texture parameters. However, errors in surface texture measurement can occur due to factors like measuring equipment, procedure, and interpretation of results. Errors can stem from different measurement methods, such as the stylus and optical methods, with issues like temperature variations impacting measurement accuracy. The text explores the impact of errors on surface texture parameter values, particularly in relation to additional valleys and repetitive measurements using optical methods. The study aims to address this gap and provide insights to enhance the quality of surface texture assessment. Various parameters are used to describe areal surface textures, categorized into different types based on their function. The text also discusses changes in surface parameters after different surface treatments
