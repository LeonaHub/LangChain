The text discusses reviews and studies on the effects of supplementing infant formula with probiotics, specifically Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 and/or Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, on the growth of healthy infants. The studies focused on parameters such as weight gain, length, and head circumference, with some examining secondary outcomes like body composition. The reviews found no significant differences in growth rates between infants fed probiotic-supplemented formula and those fed unsupplemented formula. However, caution is advised in interpreting the results due to limitations in study methodologies, small sample sizes, and short follow-up periods. The text also highlights the importance of conducting further research to understand the impact of probiotic supplementation on infant growth and emphasizes the need for longer-duration studies to accurately assess growth effects.
