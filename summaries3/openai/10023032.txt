Nutrients are crucial for maintaining reproductive function, as shown by studies demonstrating that food and cellular glucose deprivation can suppress hormone secretion in animals. Insulin-induced hypoglycemia and 2-deoxyglucose have been found to suppress LH secretion in various animal models by decreasing pulsatile GnRH secretion. A study at Yokohama City University School of Medicine investigated the impact of carbohydrates like glucose on LH secretion in estrogen-primed OVX rats. The research involved two experiments focusing on LH suppression and the mechanism of action of glucose and IIH on LH secretion using electrophysiological methods. The study found that insulin-induced hypoglycemia suppresses pulsatile LH secretion by decreasing the activity of the GnRH pulse generator, while glucose helps recover this activity and LH secretion. The research suggests that glucose plays a critical role in maintaining GnRH neuron activity and that the brain's hypoglycemia-sensing mechanism may not differentiate between glucose and mannose. The study also highlights the specific role of glucose in supporting synaptic activity and suggests that the suppression of pulsatile LH secretion may not solely be due to ATP exhaustion.
