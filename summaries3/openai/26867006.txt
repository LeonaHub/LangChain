Advancements in separation techniques for semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have enabled the production of high-purity dispersions suitable for use in printed, flexible, and stretchable electronics. Methods such as polymer-wrapping, gel-chromatography, and density gradient ultracentrifugation have facilitated the fabrication of field-effect transistors (FETs) based on dense random or aligned networks of SWNTs with effective carrier mobilities and on-conductivities, while maintaining high on/off current ratios. Recent progress in nanotube technology has led to the development of highly integrated nanotube network circuits, such as backplanes for tactile sensors and X-ray imager arrays, ring-oscillators, SRAM, and more. Researchers are exploring how different chiralities of nanotubes affect charge injection and transport in networks, and whether single-chirality networks are necessary for optimal performance. Control over the composition and density of semiconducting SWNT networks is crucial for answering these questions. Analytical tools are needed to investigate charge transport beyond current-voltage measurements, providing insight into current pathways and charge carrier distribution in nanotube networks.
