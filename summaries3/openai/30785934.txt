Clostridium difficile is a gram-positive, anaerobic bacterium that causes antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis in adults, with major virulence factors including toxins A, B, and binary toxin. Hyper-virulent strains have led to nosocomial infections and outbreaks. The epidemiology of C. difficile infections is changing, with an increasing incidence of community-associated cases in both adults and children, occurring among populations without traditional risk factors. The interest lies in determining if asymptomatic carriers of C. difficile could be a source for its transmission in healthcare and community settings to prevent community-associated CDI. The study discussed in the text aimed to determine the frequency of asymptomatic C. difficile colonization in preterm neonates over a one-year period, analyzing perinatal determinants and characterizing the isolated strains. The study found a high colonization rate early after birth with genetically related non-toxigenic strains, which diversified after hospital discharge to include toxigenic strains. The findings suggest a specific colonization pattern in this population, with an increase in non-toxigenic strains during hospitalization followed by diversification and colonization by toxigenic strains post-discharge. The data indicate an acquisition of pathogenic strains of C. difficile from the community environment, with the hospital serving as a temporary reservoir for these strains.
