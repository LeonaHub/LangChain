Ileostomies are often created to prevent complications after bowel resection but can lead to their own set of issues, including high rates of readmission due to electrolyte imbalances and dehydration. A study at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital in Australia focused on patients with newly formed ileostomies and their risk of readmission within 60 days. The study found that dehydration and acute kidney injury were common causes of readmission, with a significant decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) observed in both readmitted and non-readmitted patients. Factors associated with delayed ileostomy closure included anastomotic leak, cancer progression, and longer hospital stays. The study also highlighted the challenges in predicting dehydration and readmission risk in these patients. While some statistically significant differences were found in blood tests between readmitted and non-readmitted patients, the clinical impact of these differences may be minimal. The study suggests the need for further research on hydration strategies for patients with ileostomies to preserve renal function.
