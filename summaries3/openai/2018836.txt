Research has been conducted on the role of fibrinopeptide B release and the exposure of the NH2-terminus of the β-chain in fibrin clot formation by thrombin. Studies have examined abnormal fibrinogens with abnormal Bβ-chains, such as fibrinogens New York I, Christchurch II, Seattle I, and Pontoise, providing insights into the role of Bβ-chains. Prolonged reptilase time may be due to secondary abnormal structures in the NH2-terminal region of the α-chain or COOH-terminal region of the γ-chain. A new β-chain variant in abnormal fibrinogen Ise was studied, revealing a slow release rate of fibrinopeptide B and a specific amino acid substitution. Coagulation studies and purification of fibrinogen were conducted using various chromatography methods. The text discusses the release of fibrinopeptides A and B, fibrin monomer polymerization, and fibrin aggregation using specific methods. A case report is presented about a 50-year-old man with hypofibrinogenemia and his family members with the condition. The study found differences in the conversion of fibrinopeptide B and Bβ-chains between the propositus and normal fibrinogen samples. High thrombin concentration led to changes in fibrinogen structure, affecting Bβ-chains and α-chains. Amino acid sequences of the degraded α-chains were analyzed. The text also describes the digestion and separation of Bβ-chains from fibrinogen, revealing a heterozygous congenitally abnormal fibrinogen Ise characterized by clotting time abnormalities. The role of Bβ-chains in fibrin clot formation and the impact of delayed exposure of the NH2-terminus of the β-chain on thrombin time are discussed. Studies by various researchers support
