The text discusses the synthesis and characterization of Ag2S quantum dots, highlighting their applications and various methods used for their production. Traditional methods face challenges such as poor control of nanoparticle size and distribution, complex processes, and high costs. A reverse microemulsion approach and chemical deposition from aqueous solutions are more recent methods that offer better control over size distribution and shape. Small-angle neutron scattering is an effective technique for studying the structure of nanoparticles, particularly in colloidal solutions. The text details the synthesis of stable colloidal solutions of silver sulfide in heavy water and the analysis of their properties using techniques like dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The size of Ag2S quantum dots in colloidal solutions can be controlled by adjusting reagent concentrations, with differences observed between solutions prepared in heavy water and ordinary water. The text also discusses the photoluminescence properties of the quantum dots and their exciton binding energy. Overall, the study provides insights into the synthesis, stability, and characterization of Ag2S quantum dots
