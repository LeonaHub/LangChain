Regular moderate aerobic exercise is beneficial for cardiovascular health, but high-intensity exercise can lead to cardiac changes known as "athlete's heart." These changes include structural adaptations that enhance sports performance but may also result in unexpected cardiac remodeling known as "Phidippides cardiomyopathy." Studies suggest that soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) could be a biomarker for fibrosis and cardiac remodeling due to physical exercise, potentially impacting cardiac blood flow regulation. A study investigated the association between sVCAM-1 levels and cardiac structural changes in long-distance runners, finding a correlation between sVCAM-1 levels and left atrial remodeling, which could be linked to atrial fibrillation risk in high-performance athletes. Highly trained runners showed increased sVCAM-1 levels after intense exercise, with a significant correlation between sVCAM-1 levels and left atrial volume. The study suggests that sVCAM-1 may be a potential biomarker for assessing adverse effects on left atrial structure and function in high-performance athletes, potentially predicting the risk of atrial fibrillation. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and explore the relationship between sVCAM-1 levels and atrial fibrillation risk in athletes.
