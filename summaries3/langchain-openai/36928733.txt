The text discusses myoepithelial lesions in the head and neck region, focusing on myoepithelioma and myoepithelial carcinoma. Myoepithelioma is a rare benign salivary gland neoplasm composed of myoepithelial cells without ductal components, while myoepithelial carcinoma is a malignant counterpart with invasive growth. The article outlines the histological features, immunohistochemistry markers, and differential diagnoses for these lesions, including benign and malignant salivary gland tumors, soft tissue neoplasms, melanoma, carcinoma, and plasmacytoma. It emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive approach involving histology, immunohistochemistry, and potentially molecular studies to accurately diagnose and differentiate these challenging lesions.
