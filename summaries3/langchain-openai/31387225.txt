The study focused on optimizing the extraction of polysaccharides and antioxidant activities from brown macroalgae, specifically Laminaria hyperborea, using hydrothermal-assisted extraction (HAE) and response surface methodology. The research aimed to maximize the yields of fucose, total glucans, and antioxidant activities (FRAP and DPPH) from the macroalgae. The optimized conditions for L. hyperborea were then applied to other brown macroalgae species (Laminaria digitata and Ascophyllum nodosum). Additionally, the study explored the sequential application of ultrasound and thermal technologies on the macroalgal residues to enhance the recovery of polysaccharides. The results showed variable recoveries of fucose and total glucans depending on the macroalgal species, highlighting the need for tailored extraction approaches for different species. The study provides valuable insights for future biorefinery approaches and the potential utilization of polysaccharides from brown macroalgae for various applications.
