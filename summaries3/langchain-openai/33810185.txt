The study focused on the accumulation patterns of bioactive compounds in barley grain under high-temperature stress conditions. Four barley genotypes were compared for their deposition of dry matter, β-glucans, arabinoxylans, phenolic compounds, and antioxidant capacity. The study found that genotypic effects were more significant than environmental factors in determining the content of these bioactive compounds. Heat stress reduced grain weight but did not affect β-glucans or arabinoxylans, while increasing phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity, especially in certain genotypes. The deposition patterns varied for different compounds, with dietary fiber following grain weight, anthocyanins peaking before maturity, and phenolic compounds decreasing as grains developed. The study suggests that barley cultivation in high-temperature stress areas can enhance certain bioactive compounds and antioxidant capacity, supporting the potential for barley-based healthy food products.
