The text discusses the role of miR-210 and PTPN2 in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia (PE). It highlights that miR-210 expression is induced under hypoxia, promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in trophoblast cells, potentially contributing to the development of PE. PTPN2, a target of miR-210, is downregulated under hypoxia and inhibits the proliferation, migration, and invasion of cells. The study suggests that miR-210 and PTPN2 may serve as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for PE. The PDGFR-Akt signaling pathway is implicated in the regulation of these processes, although further research is needed to fully understand the mechanism. The study provides valuable insights into the potential mechanisms underlying PE and suggests avenues for future research and therapeutic interventions.
