The text discusses a study on phenylketonuria (PKU) in a Chinese population, focusing on genotype-phenotype correlations in patients with PKU. The study analyzed mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene and their association with different PKU phenotypes, including mild hyperphenylalaninaemia (MHP), mild PKU (mPKU), and classic PKU (cPKU). The study identified various mutations in the PAH gene and assessed their predicted residual activity (PRA) to determine their impact on enzyme function. The analysis revealed correlations between specific mutations and PKU phenotypes, with some mutations consistently associated with classic PKU, mild PKU, or MHP. However, there were instances of discordance between genotype and phenotype, suggesting the influence of other genetic or environmental factors on disease presentation. The study provides valuable insights into predicting clinical outcomes in PKU patients but also highlights the complexity of genotype-phenotype relationships in PKU.
