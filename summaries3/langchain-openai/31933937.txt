The text discusses the role of DLC-3, a Rho-GTPase-activating protein, in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). It highlights that DLC-3 is downregulated in TNBC tissues and its expression correlates with lymph node status and histologic grade. Through experiments involving gene transfection, it was found that upregulation of DLC-3 expression inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion. The study also suggests that DLC-3 may act as a tumor suppressor in TNBC and interacts with the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway. Further research is needed to fully understand the molecular mechanisms underlying DLC-3's role in TNBC.
