The text discusses the impact of aging on neuronal properties and synaptic function in Aplysia, focusing on changes in excitability and synaptic plasticity in tail sensory neurons (SN). Aging leads to a decline in neuronal excitability and synaptic strength, affecting memory and motor functions. The study explores the role of neurotransmitters like L-glutamate (L-Glu) and serotonin (5-HT) in modulating SN responses and synaptic facilitation. It highlights how aging impairs 5-HT-induced facilitation in aged SN but can be restored by activators of protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) signaling. The findings suggest that deficiencies in second messenger signaling pathways contribute to age-related learning impairments and altered neuronal functioning in Aplysia. Additionally, changes in ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) expression and function during aging impact synaptic plasticity and learning abilities. The study concludes
