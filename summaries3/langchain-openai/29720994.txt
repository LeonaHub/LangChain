The text discusses the genetic analysis of the Abyssinian pea (Pisum sativum ssp. abyssinicum) to determine its origin and relationship to other Pisum taxa. The study compared DNA sequences of 18 genes in various Pisum accessions, including P. fulvum, P. sativum, and P. elatius. The analysis revealed that Abyssinian pea alleles were more closely related to P. sativum and P. elatius alleles than to P. fulvum, suggesting a potential hybrid origin from a P. sativum × P. elatius cross. The study also examined genes related to domestication traits like pod dehiscence and seed dormancy, indicating a possible independent mutation for pod dehiscence but uncertainty regarding seed dormancy. The text concludes that the Abyssinian pea likely originated from a P. sativum × P. elatius hybridization event, with further research needed to clarify its domestication status and genetic diversity.
