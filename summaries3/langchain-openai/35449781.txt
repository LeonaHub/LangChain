The text discusses the issue of pain and discomfort experienced by orthodontic patients during treatment, particularly after the placement of the initial archwire. Various methods, including pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches, are used to alleviate this pain. The study aimed to compare the effectiveness of chewing gum and pre-emptive tenoxicam in managing orthodontic pain. The research involved female patients aged 18-25 undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment for the first time. Results showed that both chewing gum and tenoxicam effectively reduced pain levels, with chewing gum being comparable to tenoxicam in pain control. The study suggests that chewing gum can be a non-pharmacological alternative for orthodontic pain management, offering a safe and cost-effective option without adverse reactions. Further research with larger sample sizes is recommended to establish standardized protocols for pain management in orthodontic treatment.
