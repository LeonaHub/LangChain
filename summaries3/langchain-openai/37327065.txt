The text discusses the challenges in identifying sepsis in the prehospital setting and the use of Early Warning Scores (EWS) for this purpose. A scoping review was conducted, including 23 studies on EWS for prehospital sepsis identification. The review found that EWS performed inconsistently and inadequately for this purpose, with variations in sensitivity and specificity. The experts consulted highlighted the need for standardized protocols, clinical judgment, and sepsis education in prehospital care. Suggestions were made to explore new vital signs or biomarkers, such as end-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring, to enhance prehospital sepsis identification. Limitations of the review were noted, including missing data and lack of homogeneity in study methodologies. The conclusion emphasizes the importance of improving prehospital care for septic patients through standardized protocols, education, and real-time data feedback, with a call for prospective modeling to evaluate interventions and outcomes.
