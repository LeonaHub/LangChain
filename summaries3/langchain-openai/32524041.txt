The text discusses a study that investigated the effects of brain-responsive neurostimulation (RNS System) on sleep in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. The study involved six subjects implanted with the RNS System who underwent polysomnography (PSG) to assess sleep patterns in relation to neurostimulation. The study found that RNS System stimulations did not disrupt sleep, with arousals tending to peak before stimulations rather than after. The results suggest that epileptiform activity may cause both arousals and stimulations, indicating a potential advantage of RNS System over other neurostimulation modalities in terms of sleep disruption. The study highlights the need for further research on the effects of neurostimulation on sleep and the development of improved devices with better side effect profiles.
