The text discusses the role of eosinophils in inflammatory conditions, particularly in bronchial asthma, and the therapeutic implications of targeting eosinophils in severe eosinophilic asthma. It explains the biology of eosinophils, their activation, and effector functions, as well as the factors influencing their differentiation, maturation, and survival. The text also delves into the mechanisms of action of anti-IL-5RÎ± monoclonal antibodies, such as benralizumab, in depleting eosinophils and other IL-5R+ cells. Furthermore, it addresses the safety concerns related to eosinophil depletion, including potential impacts on parasitic infections, viral defense, tumor immunology, and autoimmune responses. The text concludes by highlighting the need for further research to better understand the safety and efficacy of eosinophil-lowering agents like benralizumab in clinical practice.
