The text discusses the clinical application of the IllumiScan, a fluorescence visualization device, for detecting oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and leukoplakia. The study compared the IllumiScan with other screening methods such as Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) and the Iodine Staining Method (IOM). The IllumiScan was found to be effective in distinguishing between cancerous and normal areas, with high sensitivity and specificity for OSCC and leukoplakia. The device's ability to detect OSCC in keratinized mucosa was highlighted, although accurate identification of lesion areas may be challenging. Combining the IllumiScan with other screening methods could enhance diagnostic accuracy in oral mucosal lesions.
