The text discusses the implementation and outcomes of a psychiatric blog, "Bleib Zuhause," launched during the Covid-19 pandemic to support patients with chronic psychiatric disorders. The blog aimed to provide daily content from various therapeutic professions to help patients maintain a routine during lockdown. Despite positive feedback from patients, limited patient involvement and feedback were noted. The blog reached a constant readership, but challenges included limited patient interaction and difficulty in sustaining interest. The authors emphasize the need for more sophisticated tools to enhance patient involvement in psychiatric care during public health crises.
