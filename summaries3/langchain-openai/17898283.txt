The text discusses a study on the 3D histomorphometric quantification of optic nerve head (ONH) and peripapillary neural and connective tissues in monkeys with early experimental glaucoma. The study focuses on the position and thickness of the lamina cribrosa, scleral flange, and peripapillary sclera to characterize regional patterns of deformation and thickness alterations at the onset of ONH surface change. The findings suggest permanent posterior deformation and thickening of the lamina cribrosa, scleral flange, and peripapillary sclera in early glaucoma. The study highlights the importance of understanding these structural changes in relation to individual susceptibility to glaucoma and the biomechanical behavior of ONH tissues. The study also discusses the implications of these findings for clinical imaging and the potential for early detection of glaucomatous damage.
