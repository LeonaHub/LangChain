The text discusses the synthesis and characterization of a molybdenum cluster, [Mo6Cl14]2–, and its potential application as a sensor for detecting nitroaromatic compounds, specifically trinitrotoluene (TNT). Experimental and computational methods were employed to study the photophysical properties of the cluster and its interaction with TNT. The fluorescence of the molybdenum cluster was quenched by TNT, with the Stern–Volmer equation used to describe the quenching process. The study showed that concentrations higher than 4 × 10–5 mM of TNT could be detected through the quenching of the cluster's fluorescence. Theoretical calculations indicated significant involvement of TNT in the active molecular orbitals of the cluster-TNT complex, leading to the quenching of luminescence. The results suggest that the molybdenum cluster has potential as a sensor for detecting nitroaromatic explosives, although further studies on selectivity and real-world applications are needed for validation.
