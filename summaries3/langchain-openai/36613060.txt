The text discusses the validation and psychometric properties of the Children's Eating Attitude Test (ChEAT) in a sample of Chinese children aged 9 to 13 years. The study involved 906 children from grades three to five in Shanghai, China. The ChEAT questionnaire was used to assess eating attitudes and behaviors, with factors identified including fear of getting fat, dieting and purging behaviors, bulimia and food preoccupation, and social pressure to eat. The study found good internal consistency, reliability, and validity of the Chinese version of the ChEAT. Gender differences were observed in eating behaviors, with girls showing more fear of getting fat and social pressure to eat. The study also found correlations between ChEAT scores and BMI, with overweight girls having higher ChEAT scores and boys with lower BMI experiencing higher social eating pressure. The study concludes that the Chinese version of the ChEAT is a reliable tool for evaluating eating attitudes and behaviors in Chinese children, providing valuable insights for cross-cultural studies on eating disorders in children.
