The text discusses a rare case of Kawasaki Disease (KD) in an adult following the administration of the Vaxzevria COVID-19 vaccine. KD is a vasculitis condition typically seen in children, characterized by fever, rash, conjunctival injection, and other symptoms. The patient presented with atypical manifestations of KD, including liver involvement and acute kidney injury. Treatment involved intravenous immunoglobulin and individualized aspirin dosing. The case was classified as an Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI) with an indeterminate causal association to the vaccine. The rarity of KD in adults and the importance of monitoring and reporting vaccine-related adverse events are highlighted, emphasizing the overall benefits of vaccination outweighing the risks. The text underscores the need for continued surveillance and transparency in vaccine safety monitoring to maintain public trust and ensure public health protection during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
