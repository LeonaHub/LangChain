The text discusses a case report of a Japanese woman with Lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI) who initially presented with renal tubular acidosis (RTA)/Fanconi syndrome and rickets. Despite lacking typical LPI symptoms like protein aversion and hyperammonemia, genetic analysis revealed a homozygous nonsense variant of SLC7A7, confirming the diagnosis. The patient exhibited various kidney abnormalities, including tubular and glomerular changes, with evidence of immune abnormalities resembling systemic lupus erythematosus. The study highlights the importance of considering LPI in patients with renal tubular diseases, even without typical symptoms, and emphasizes the value of comprehensive genetic analysis for accurate diagnosis. The authors declare no conflicts of interest, and ethical standards were followed, with informed consent obtained from all patients.
