The text discusses the importance of collagen, particularly from aquatic species like the soft-shelled turtle (SST), as an alternative to terrestrial animal-derived collagens due to safety concerns and dietary restrictions. The study focuses on identifying specific peptide biomarkers from SST calipash collagen for pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications. Through PTM detection-based peptidomics analysis, specific peptide sequences were selected and verified using mass spectrometry. The study identified eight STG-specific peptide biomarkers, which were synthesized and validated for STG authentication. The method presented offers a reliable approach for STG authentication and traceability, ensuring product quality and safety for consumers.
