The study focused on the impact of l-Lysine-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (lys@IONPs) on the formation of microalgal biofilms using Chlorella vulgaris as a model organism. The nanoparticles were synthesized and characterized, showing a concentration-dependent effect on biofilm formation. Low concentrations of lys@IONPs (12.5-200 µg/mL) promoted cell growth and biofilm formation, while higher concentrations (≥400 µg/mL) initially reduced biofilm formation but led to adaptation over time. The nanoparticles interacted with the microalgal cells, inducing cellular adaptation and promoting biofilm formation. The study highlights the potential of lys@IONPs to influence microalgal biofilm formation in industrial processes, emphasizing the importance of concentration and exposure time in determining their effects.
