The text discusses a study conducted in Japan on the impact of treatment costs on the decisions made by physicians and patients regarding optimal cancer treatment for Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) and transplant-ineligible Multiple Myeloma (MM). The study found that while most patients did not face non-optimal treatment due to costs, a significant percentage of CML and MM patients may undergo such treatment due to financial constraints. Factors such as patient age, occupation status, and treatment duration were identified as influencing decisions related to treatment costs. The study highlighted differences in physician attitudes towards treatment costs and their impact on treatment recommendations. Overall, the study suggests that while treatment costs are a concern for both physicians and patients, their influence on treatment decisions may be limited in Japan. Further research is recommended to explore the reasons behind these decisions and their implications.
