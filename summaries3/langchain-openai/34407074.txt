The text discusses a study on the structure, function, and dynamics of farmland arthropod communities in Northeast China. The research aimed to explore the interrelationships between species within the community, focusing on the internal mechanism of mutual restraint, occurrence and development of pests, pest population forecasting, and optimal control. The study was conducted at a permanent farmland plot in the Dehui Agro-ecological Experimental Station, analyzing the composition and quantity structure of the insect community, variation of species frequency, dynamic changes of nutritional function groups, ecological dominance, and biodiversity distribution. The findings highlighted the dominance of herbivorous pests, the role of natural enemies, and the impact of human factors on community diversity. The study provides insights into farmland insect populations and their interactions, laying the groundwork for future research on self-regulation and pest control in agricultural ecosystems.
