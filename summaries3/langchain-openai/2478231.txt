The text discusses the heterogeneity of the human plasma fibrinogen γ chain, specifically focusing on the γ50, γ55, and γ57.5 forms. It mentions the differential splicing event in the RNA sequences encoding the platelet recognition site and factor XIIIa-mediated crosslinking sites. The study investigates the role of the γ57.5 chain in platelet-fibrinogen interactions using synthetic peptides and MoAb L2B. The results suggest that the γ57.5 chain primarily binds to platelets via the γ50 chain, with the C-terminal sequences of γ57.5 not directly involved in platelet interactions defined by RGD or dodecapeptide sequences. The L2B epitope is localized to residues R-409-PEH-412, and the secondary structure analysis predicts an α-helical structure for the γ57.5408-416 sequence. The availability of the L2B epitope in fibrin suggests surface exposure of the γ57.5 C-terminus in the fibrin clot, supporting the proposed structure of crosslinked fibrin γ chain dimers.
