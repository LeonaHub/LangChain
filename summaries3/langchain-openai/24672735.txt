The text discusses the interplay between viruses and the sphingolipid system, focusing on the role of sphingosine kinase (SK) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) metabolizing enzymes in regulating virus replication. It highlights the impact of SK1 and S1P lyase on influenza virus replication, detailing how SK inhibition affects NF-ÎºB activation and viral RNA synthesis. The text also explores the interaction of SK with other viruses such as human cytomegalovirus, bovine viral diarrhea virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and dengue virus type-2, showcasing how these viruses modulate SK activity to promote or inhibit their replication. Overall, understanding the relationship between viruses and sphingolipid metabolism could lead to the development of novel antiviral strategies.
