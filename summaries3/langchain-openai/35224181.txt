The text discusses a series of studies that aimed to evaluate the impact of exposure to social comparison information through Fitbit challenges on physical activity levels in sedentary adults. The studies utilized within-subject, single-case experimental designs to examine the effects of engaging in challenges prompting upward or downward comparison with active or sedentary confederates. Results showed variability in participants' responses to challenges, with those exposed to the active confederate first generally displaying larger increases in daily steps. Factors such as perceived similarity, psychological closeness, and perceived ability for performance were noted to impact outcomes. The studies highlighted the importance of individual and situational factors in responding to social comparison and competition, suggesting the need for further research to understand the effectiveness of such interventions in increasing physical activity.
