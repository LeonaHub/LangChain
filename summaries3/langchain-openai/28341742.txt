The text discusses the regulation of viral fusion, specifically focusing on the avian sarcoma and leukosis virus (ASLV), by factors such as endosomal pH, cell-specific factors, and the interferon-inducible transmembrane protein IFITM3. The study examines the kinetics of ASLV fusion with different cell types expressing distinct receptor isoforms and the impact of IFITM3 expression on viral fusion. Experimental procedures include the use of single-virus imaging assays, BlaM assays, and endosomal pH measurements to investigate the mechanisms underlying ASLV fusion. The results suggest that both cell-extrinsic factors (such as buffer pH) and cell-intrinsic factors (like IFITM3) can influence the efficiency and kinetics of ASLV fusion. The study also highlights the importance of controlling extracellular pH during experiments and the role of endosomal acidification in modulating viral fusion. The findings provide insights into the complex interplay of factors that regulate viral entry and fusion processes.
