The text describes the development of a chronic cranial window with an access port using a silicone plug, allowing for repeated in vivo optical imaging and access to the brain for cellular manipulations. The device is easy to fabricate, adaptable to typical surgical procedures, and maintains imaging quality over long periods. It permits easy access for substance delivery, electrical stimulation, and recording at a single-cell resolution. The device was successfully used for repeated dye injections, functional imaging, and whole-cell patch clamp recordings in mice. The technique allows for reduced animal usage, long-term experiments, and a combination of optical imaging with cellular manipulation or electrophysiological recording.
