The text discusses the metabolism and biological roles of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), specifically focusing on the conversion of ω-6 and ω-3 PUFAs to oxylipin metabolites by cytochrome P450 enzymes. The ω-6 PUFA, arachidonic acid (ARA), is metabolized to hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) by CYP enzymes, with 20-HETE being a major regioisomer. The ω-3 PUFAs, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are also metabolized to corresponding epoxy- and hydroxy-PUFAs. The text describes the practical chemical synthesis of these ω-hydroxy PUFAs and their biological evaluation, focusing on their effects on pain perception and TRPV1 activation. The results show that while 20-HETE induces pain and has minimal TRPV1 activation, 20-HEPE and 22-HDoHE are potent TRPV1 agonists without inducing pain, suggesting potential therapeutic properties. The study highlights the distinct effects of ω-6 and ω-3 derived metabolites and the importance of further exploration of their mechanisms of action in pain biology.
