The text discusses the complex relationship between obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) severity and dyslipidaemia, a condition characterized by abnormal lipid levels. The study, based on a large sample size, reveals a nonlinear and non-monotonic association between OSA severity and dyslipidaemia. Various OSA indices, including the apnoea-hypopnea index (AHI), oxygen desaturation index (ODI), and arousal index (ArI), were analyzed to identify specific lipid risk factors at different stages of OSA. The findings suggest that the risk of dyslipidaemia does not linearly increase with OSA severity, and different lipid factors are associated with different stages of OSA severity. The study highlights the importance of considering multiple OSA indices and lipid risk factors in understanding the complex relationship between OSA and dyslipidaemia, providing valuable insights for clinical research and management of these conditions.
