The text discusses the synthesis and characterization of high χ-low N block copolymers (BCPs) using oligosaccharide-based building blocks and CuAAC click chemistry. The study focuses on the effect of electrostatic interactions at the BCP interface on self-assembly, particularly in thin films. By introducing T+/counteranion– junctions through n-alkylation, the researchers were able to enhance BCP microphase separation and achieve long-range aligned microphase-separated morphologies. The results demonstrate the potential of utilizing electrostatic interactions within ionic nanochannels to control BCP self-assembly and achieve uniform, sub-10 nm domain structures in thin films. This approach could have applications in nanopatterning for nanoelectronics and nanoionics for electrochemical energy storage.
