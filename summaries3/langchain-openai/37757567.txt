The text discusses the importance of understanding the electrical and mechanical activities of the cardiovascular system during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) after cardiac arrest (CA). It highlights the use of electrocardiographic (ECG) signals to monitor electrical activities and photoplethysmography (PPG) signals to monitor mechanical activities. The study introduces the concept of cross recurrence quantitative analysis (CRQA) to analyze the coupling of these two systems during CPR. The research involved experiments on pigs to analyze ECG and PPG signals at different stages of CPR, including Baseline, CA, CPR, and recovery of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The results showed significant changes in the dynamics of electrical and mechanical coupling during CPR, with implications for evaluating the effectiveness of CPR and predicting outcomes. The study suggests that analyzing the electrical-mechanical coupling could serve as a physiological biomarker for assessing CPR progress and improving emergency treatment strategies.
