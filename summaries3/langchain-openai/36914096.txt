The study focused on estimating the Lifetime Risk (LTR) of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) among participants from the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS) cohort in Iran. The research aimed to assess the impact of individual and aggregate risk factors, such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and hypercholesterolemia, on the LTR of CVD in men and women. The study found that LTR for total CVD was higher in individuals with a greater risk factor burden, with women showing a more pronounced effect of risk factors on CVD risk compared to men. The absence of traditional risk factors in young and middle-aged individuals was associated with increased CVD-free survival, suggesting the potential for reducing premature CVD burden through early risk factor prevention strategies. The study highlights the importance of primordial prevention and maintaining optimal risk factor levels to reduce the long-term burden of CVD in both sexes.
