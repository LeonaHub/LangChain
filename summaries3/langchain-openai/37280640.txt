The text discusses a study conducted in England to examine kcal labelling practices, customer purchasing behavior, and levels of noticing and using kcal labelling in the out-of-home food sector (OHFS) prior to the implementation of mandatory kcal labelling regulations. The study found that a minority of businesses provided kcal labelling, with high energy content in purchased and consumed meals. Customers tended to underestimate the energy content of their purchases. Noticing and use of kcal labelling were low, with only a small percentage reporting it influenced their purchasing decisions. The study highlights the need for increased awareness, use, and understanding of kcal labelling in the OHFS. Future research is recommended to assess the impact of mandatory kcal labelling on consumer behavior and public health.
