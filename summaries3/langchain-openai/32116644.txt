The text discusses the role of electrophile signaling in the central nervous system (CNS), focusing on endogenous reactive electrophilic metabolites and their implications in neurodegenerative diseases. It highlights the abundance of lipid-derived electrophiles (LDEs) in the CNS and the challenges in studying LDE signaling due to the lack of protein-specific tractability. The text introduces high-throughput chemoproteomics methods like activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) and Targetable Reactive Electrophiles and Oxidants (T-REX) for identifying LDE-sensitive proteins. It also explores the potential targets and pathways involved in the mechanism of action of Dimethyl Fumarate (DMF) in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS), including Keap1/Nrf2/AR signaling, PKCθ, GAPDH, HCA2, p65, IκBα, and RSK/MSK kinases. The text emphasizes the need for a better understanding of electrophile signaling in
