The text discusses a study on Clostridium difficile colonization in preterm neonates (PN) in a NICU over a one-year period. The study found a high rate of C. difficile colonization in PN, with a significant increase during hospitalization and a decrease after discharge. Most strains were non-toxigenic, with two dominant ribotypes persisting during hospitalization, suggesting potential hospital transmission. Toxigenic strains emerged after discharge, with some strains persisting over time. The study highlights the dynamics of C. difficile colonization in PN and the potential role of PN as a transient reservoir for pathogenic strains.
