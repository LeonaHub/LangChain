The study investigated the correlation between air pollutants and spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) in Taiwanese patients using the National Health Insurance Research Database and government open data. Data on air pollutants and sICH cases were analyzed, with findings indicating that NO2 pollution was highly correlated with sICH incidence, particularly in middle-aged and elderly patients. PM10 and PM2.5 were identified as significant risk factors for sICH. Age was found to modulate the effects of air pollutants on sICH incidence. The study highlighted the need for further research to adjust air pollution control policies and cut-off levels. Limitations included differences in pollutant detection locations and time frames. Further investigations with laboratory data and multivariate analysis are recommended for a more precise understanding of air pollution's impact on sICH.
