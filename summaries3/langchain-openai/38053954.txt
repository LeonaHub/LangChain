The text discusses a study that aimed to investigate the effects of Quiet Eye (QE) training on attention deficits in children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The study involved 72 children with ADHD who were assigned to a QE training group or a control group. The QE training involved targeting tasks with a focus on eye fixations and gaze control. The results showed that QE training led to improvements in focused attention, concentration performance, and catch performance in the QE training group compared to the control group. The study suggests that QE training may be an effective method for ameliorating attention deficits in children with ADHD. However, the study did not find significant effects on tonic attention or phasic attention. Further research is recommended to explore non-pharmacological therapies for ADHD.
