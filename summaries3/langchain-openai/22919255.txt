The text discusses the association between XRCC1 gene polymorphisms (Arg194Trp, Arg280His, and Arg399Gln) and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted on 11 studies involving 2075 HCC patients and 2604 controls. The study found no significant association between the Arg194Trp and Arg399Gln polymorphisms and HCC risk. However, the Arg280His polymorphism showed a potential association with increased HCC risk, although sensitivity analysis did not strongly support this. The study highlighted the need for further research with larger sample sizes and diverse populations to clarify these associations. No publication biases were detected in the analysis.
