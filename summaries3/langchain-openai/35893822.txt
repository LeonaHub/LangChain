The text discusses the importance of mucosal immunity in responding to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the potential for mucosal vaccines to enhance immune responses. It highlights the role of BAFF/APRIL cytokines and homeostatic chemokines like CXCL13, CCL19, and CCL21 in promoting local immune responses, including the formation of inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT). Studies have shown that iBALT formation can enhance immune responses against viral respiratory infections, including SARS-CoV-2. The text also suggests using BAFF/APRIL or CXCL13 as adjuvants in mucosal vaccines to boost the local mucosal immune response against SARS-CoV-2.
