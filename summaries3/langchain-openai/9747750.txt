The text discusses a case of Sheehan's syndrome, a pituitary necrosis following postpartum hemorrhage, with emphasis on the importance of early diagnosis and differentiation from alternative diagnoses such as lymphocytic hypophysitis and necrosis of a macroadenoma. The patient presented with acute symptoms post-delivery, including severe headache and hormonal deficiencies, leading to extensive testing and imaging. The MRI findings of an enlarged pituitary gland with specific characteristics supported the diagnosis of pituitary ischemia. The clinical course, marked by rapid shrinkage of the pituitary mass, further confirmed the diagnosis of Sheehan's syndrome. Differentiation from hypophysitis and macroadenoma necrosis is crucial for appropriate treatment
