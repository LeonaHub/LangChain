The text discusses the development and characterization of chitosan nanoparticles (CS NPs) loaded with the anticancer drugs betaine (BT) and nedaplatin (ND), either individually or in combination, and coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) for enhanced drug delivery in breast cancer treatment. The study involved in vitro and in vivo experiments to evaluate the cytotoxicity and tumor size reduction effects of these nanoformulations. Results showed that PEGylation improved the physicochemical properties and drug release profiles of the nanoparticles. The BT-ND/PEG-CS NPs exhibited the highest cytotoxicity against cancer cells and the most significant reduction in tumor size in breast cancer-bearing rats, suggesting their potential as a promising therapeutic strategy for breast cancer treatment.
