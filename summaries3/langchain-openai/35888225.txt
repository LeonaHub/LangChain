The text discusses the impact of measurement errors on surface texture parameters. It highlights how errors related to measurement methods, such as stylus and optical methods, can affect surface topography measurements. The study focuses on the sensitivity of various surface texture parameters to errors, including the presence of additional valleys and repetitive measurements. The research shows that different parameters react differently to errors, with changes depending on the type of surface and the nature of the error. The study emphasizes the importance of proper measurement procedures and relocation methods to minimize variations in surface texture parameters. Overall, the findings aim to improve the selection and assessment of surface texture parameters in industrial applications, particularly for surfaces measured using optical methods.
