The text discusses a systematic review (SR) conducted to evaluate the current evidence on lifestyle modifications and nonpharmacologic interventions for psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The review aimed to identify the effectiveness of these interventions in improving quality of life for PsA patients. The study included various types of studies, such as qualitative and quantitative methodologies, and focused on outcomes related to patient-reported outcomes. The review identified a limited number of studies that met the inclusion criteria, with a total of 8 studies included in the analysis. The studies examined interventions such as physical activity, diet, mud bath therapy, and smoking cessation. The results showed some positive effects of exercise, diet, and mud bath therapy on PsA outcomes, but the evidence was limited and of low quality. The review highlighted the need for further high-quality research to determine the impact of lifestyle modifications and nonpharmacologic interventions on PsA outcomes.
