The text discusses the role of adiponectin, an adipokine, in the regulation of reproductive functions in females. Adiponectin is produced in various tissues and acts through receptors AdipoR1 and AdipoR2. It circulates in different forms and concentrations in the body, influencing metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and inflammation. Adiponectin and its receptors are expressed in the hypothalamus, pituitary, ovaries, uterus, embryos, placenta, and trophoblasts, affecting various processes such as hormone secretion, steroidogenesis, prostaglandin synthesis, and embryo development. Adiponectin's effects are tissue-specific and vary during different stages of the reproductive cycle and pregnancy. The hormone plays a crucial role in maternal-fetal interactions, trophoblast invasion, and placental metabolism, highlighting its significance in reproductive health and pregnancy outcomes.
