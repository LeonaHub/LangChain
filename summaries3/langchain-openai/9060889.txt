The text discusses a study that aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of myocardial single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) performed with simultaneous intravenous dipyridamole injection during exercise compared to exercise testing alone in patients with inadequate physical performance. The study included patients who did not achieve a high enough heart rate or peak O2 consumption during exercise testing. Results showed that the addition of dipyridamole during exercise significantly improved the diagnostic yield of myocardial SPECT without compromising the prognostic data obtained from a maximal subjective exercise test. The combination of dipyridamole and exercise enhanced sensitivity and negative predictive value compared to exercise testing alone. The study suggests that systematic dipyridamole administration during exercise testing can be beneficial in patients with inadequate physical performance, allowing clinicians to obtain clinical and ECG information from exercise testing while optimizing myocardial SPECT results.
