The text discusses a study that evaluated the microhardness of coronal dentin using the BioDent RPI technique and traditional Knoop hardness test. The study also utilized micro-Raman spectroscopy to analyze the chemical composition and crystallinity of dentin. Results showed that dentin hardness decreased from superficial to deep dentin, with BioDent RPI providing more consistent results. Chemical analysis revealed that superficial dentin had higher mineral content, while deep dentin had more organic matrix and carbonate content. Additionally, the degree of crystallinity decreased from superficial to deep dentin. These findings suggest a positive relationship between dentin hardness and mineral content, and a negative relationship with carbonate content and crystallinity. The study highlights the gradient nature of dentin's mechanical properties and microstructure.
