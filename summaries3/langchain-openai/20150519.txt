The text discusses a study on ion fluxes in the pitchers of three Nepenthes species: N. ampullaria, N. bicalcarata, and N. rafflesiana. The study used the MIFE technique to measure NH4+ and H+ fluxes across the pitcher walls of these species. The results showed interspecific differences in ion fluxes, with N. rafflesiana having the highest NH4+ uptake rate and actively pumping H+ into the pitcher fluid. N. ampullaria and N. bicalcarata maintained less acidic pitcher conditions and showed active transport of NH4+ ions. The study also examined gland distribution and morphology, with N. rafflesiana possessing digestive glands in zones A to C and lunate cells in zones D and E, while N. ampullaria and N. bicalcarata lacked lunate cells and epicuticular waxes. The findings suggest that the species have evolved different strategies for nutrient sequestration and prey capture.
