The text discusses the significance of BORIS and SOCS3 as potential biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prognosis. BORIS, a DNA-binding protein, is found to be highly expressed in various human malignancies, including HCC, and is associated with poor prognosis. In contrast, SOCS3, a suppressor of cytokine signaling, is frequently hypermethylated in cancers and its loss is linked to cell growth and migration in HCC. The study conducted immunohistochemical staining on liver tissues from HCC patients and found that high BORIS expression and low SOCS3 expression were independent risk factors for poor prognosis in HCC. The combination of BORIS and SOCS3 expression provided better prognostic value than either marker alone, with patients showing low BORIS and high SOCS3 expression having the most favorable outcomes. The study also revealed a negative correlation between BORIS and SOCS3 expression in HCC, suggesting a potential epigenetic regulation mechanism. Overall, the findings suggest that BORIS and SOCS3 could serve as novel prognostic biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for HCC.
