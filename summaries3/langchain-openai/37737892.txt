The text discusses Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection and its neurological manifestations, particularly in patients with neuralgic amyotrophy/plexus neuritis and encephalitis. The study evaluated patients with acute HEV infection and retrospectively analyzed serological data from patients with various neurological diseases. The findings suggest a possible association between HEV infection and neurological manifestations, with elevated anti-HEV-IgM and anti-HEV-IgG levels observed in some cases. The study highlights the importance of considering HEV in unusual neurological cases and the need for further research to understand the relationship between HEV infection and neurological diseases, particularly in patients with AIDP/CIDP.
