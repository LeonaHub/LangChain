The text describes the synthesis and evaluation of ergosterone-triazol hybrid molecules for their antileishmanial activity. The compounds were synthesized through a series of chemical reactions starting from ergosterol and triazol, resulting in Erg-GTr and Erg-GTr2 derivatives. These compounds were tested on Leishmania mexicana promastigotes and human dermic fibroblasts to determine their cytotoxic effects. The results showed that the Erg-GTr and Erg-GTr2 compounds exhibited high cytotoxicity against the parasites, with Erg-GTr2 being more effective and selective. Further analysis revealed that these compounds induced regulated cell death in the parasites, affecting mitochondrial membrane potential, intracellular ROS levels, phosphatidylserine exposure, and Ca2+ release from acidocalcisomes. The study suggests that these ergosterone-triazol hybrid molecules could be potential candidates for the development of new antileishmanial drugs.
