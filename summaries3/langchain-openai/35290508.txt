The text discusses the importance of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) in diagnosing prostate cancer (PCa) and staging the disease. It describes the development and validation of a comprehensive mEPE-score based on PI-RADS v2.1 criteria for predicting pathologic extra prostatic extension (pEPE) of PCa. The study involved evaluating individual mEPE features, creating a scoring system, and comparing its performance with existing quantitative scoring systems. The mEPE-score demonstrated good diagnostic accuracy, with high sensitivity and specificity for predicting pEPE. The study highlights the importance of using a standardized scoring system for consistent and reliable assessment of pEPE in PCa patients undergoing mpMRI.
