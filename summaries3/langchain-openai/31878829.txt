The text discusses the role of the lncRNA HOXA11-AS in keloid formation, highlighting its upregulation in keloid tissues and fibroblasts. The study demonstrates that HOXA11-AS inhibits apoptosis and promotes angiogenesis in keloid fibroblasts by sponging miR-124-3p, which in turn targets TGFÎ²R1 and activates the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. The findings suggest a novel mechanism for keloid formation and propose targeting HOXA11-AS or restoring miR-124-3p as potential therapeutic strategies for keloid treatment. Limitations include a small sample size and the need for further in vivo and pre-clinical studies to validate these findings.
