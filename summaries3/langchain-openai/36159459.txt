The text discusses the extraction and effects of dietary fiber from sweet potato peels on gut microbiota in vitro fermentation. Various extraction methods, including hot water extraction, ultrasonic extraction, subcritical water extraction, and microwave extraction, were used to obtain soluble dietary fiber. In vitro simulated intestinal fermentation experiments were conducted to analyze the impact of these dietary fibers on gut microbiota composition, short-chain fatty acid production, gas production, pH levels, ammonia content, and reducing sugar content. The results indicated that dietary fiber from sweet potato peels positively influenced gut health by promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria like Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, reducing harmful bacteria, and enhancing the production of short-chain fatty acids. Ultrasonic extraction showed the most significant improvement in intestinal microecology among the extraction methods studied.
