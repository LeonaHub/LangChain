The text discusses the role of LTBP2 gene mutations in primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) and the study conducted to investigate this association. The study involved mutation screening of the LTBP2 gene in PACG patients, revealing several sequence variations, including novel coding variations. Through bioinformatics analysis and comparison with control individuals, two coding mutations, p. Gln1417Arg and p. Gly1660Trp, were identified as potential contributors to PACG. These mutations were absent in control samples, affected amino acids differing in size from the wild type, and were predicted to be potentially damaging to protein function. The study suggests that these mutations, along with other factors, may play a role in the manifestation of PACG, highlighting the need for further research in larger patient samples to better understand the genetic basis of the disease.
