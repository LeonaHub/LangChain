The text discusses the impact of radiation exposure on vascular endothelial cells in organs such as the lung and kidney, leading to long-term vascular dysfunction. The study focuses on the role of Delta-like ligand 4 (Dll4) in mediating radiation-induced alterations in vascular structure and function. Using consomic rat models with reduced Dll4 expression, the study demonstrates improved survival and reduced vascular injury in Dll4-low rats compared to Dll4-high rats following radiation exposure. The study utilizes non-invasive 2nd window NIR imaging to track changes in vascular permeability and pharmacokinetic modeling to assess vascular function. The findings suggest that Dll4 plays a critical role in mediating radiation-induced vascular dysfunction and could be a potential therapeutic target for mitigating pathological vascular remodeling post-radiation injury. Further research will focus on understanding the mechanisms underlying long-term endothelial dysfunction following radiation at the single-cell level.
