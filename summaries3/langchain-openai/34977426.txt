The text discusses the utility of studying in vitro sensory neuron models of pain, focusing on human dorsal root ganglion (hDRG) neurons and stem cell-derived sensory neurons (SC-SNs). It highlights the advantages of using cell models in preclinical pain research, such as reduced expense and ease of manipulation. The text emphasizes the importance of studying human models to avoid species differences and improve translational research. It discusses the similarities and differences between hDRG neurons and rodent sensory neurons, as well as the challenges and limitations of using hDRG neurons and SC-SNs in pain research. Additionally, it explores the potential of multicellular systems and organoids in studying cell-to-cell interactions in pain. Overall, the text underscores the need for a comprehensive understanding of the strengths and limitations of each model to advance preclinical pain research effectively.
