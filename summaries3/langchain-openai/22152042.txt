The text discusses the biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (SNPs) using Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as a model system. The study focuses on the involvement of various cellular proteins in the biosynthesis and capping of SNPs. In vitro and in vivo methods were used for SNPs synthesis, with in vivo synthesis being faster. The proteins associated with SNPs were identified using mass spectrometry, revealing proteins from the oxidoreductive machinery of C. reinhardtii cells. Protein depletion experiments confirmed the role of these proteins in controlling the size and morphology of the synthesized nanoparticles. The study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms and protein involvement in SNPs biosynthesis, highlighting the potential applications of biologically synthesized SNPs. Various characterization techniques such as TEM, EDAX, and SDS-PAGE were employed to analyze the synthesized nanoparticles and associated proteins.
