The text discusses the magneto-strain effects in the 2D ferromagnetic van der Waals material CrGeTe3. This material exhibits unique properties such as thermal stability, ultralow-energy glass formation, and intrinsic gap tunability, making it suitable for various applications in nanoelectronics and memory devices. The magneto-strain effect in CrGeTe3 arises from the interplay between in-plane lattice contraction and out-of-plane spin polarization, leading to changes in the electronic structure and magnetic interactions.

Experimental and theoretical studies have revealed that the magneto-strain effects in CrGeTe3 are associated with an isostructural transition across the Curie temperature (TC). The in-plane lattice contraction increases electron-electron correlation between Cr atoms, shifting bands away from the Fermi level and causing band broadening. Out-of-plane lattice contraction enhances interlayer interactions, resulting in twinned electronic bands in the ferromagnetic phase.

The magnetic properties of CrGeTe3, such as the easy axis of magnetization along the c-axis, are influenced by the magneto-strain effects. The electronic structure analysis shows the hybridization of Cr 3d, Ge 4p, and Te 5p states, with changes in band structures and spin polarization observed across the magnetic phase transition. X-ray and photoelectron spectroscopy studies further support the presence of localized Cr states and enhanced spin-polarized electronic states in CrGeTe3.

Overall, the magneto-strain effects in CrGeTe3 demonstrate the potential for strain engineering and
