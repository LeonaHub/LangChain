The text discusses a prospective cohort study conducted to measure cervical shear wave speed (SWS) using ultrasound elastography in twin and singleton pregnancies. The study aimed to evaluate cervical softness as a potential indicator of preterm birth risk. Results showed that twin pregnancies had significantly lower SWS at the lower point of the cervix compared to singleton pregnancies in the mid-trimester. The study highlighted the importance of monitoring cervical softness in twin pregnancies and suggested that SWS measurement could be a valuable tool for assessing preterm birth risk in these cases. Further research is needed to explore the potential of SWS in preterm surveillance for twin pregnancies.
