The text discusses a study conducted using data from the UK Biobank to investigate the associations of walking pace and handgrip strength with the risk of new-onset dementia. The study included a large sample size of participants without prevalent dementia at baseline. The findings revealed that faster walking pace was inversely associated with the risk of dementia, with the lowest risk observed in individuals with both faster walking pace and higher handgrip strength. The study also highlighted the modifying effects of age and APOE Îµ4 dosage on the relationship between walking pace and dementia risk. The results suggest that assessing combined measures of physical function, genetic profile, and age could help in identifying individuals at risk of dementia.
