The text discusses the use of Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) measures in survivors and survivorship care of high-grade glioma, the most common primary brain tumor in adults. PROs are essential for evaluating the impact of treatment on Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and symptom management in clinical trials and daily clinical practice. Various PRO measures are used, including HRQoL assessments like EORTC QLQ-C30 and symptom-specific tools like MDASI-BT and NFBrSI-24. Challenges in integrating PROs include engaging healthcare professionals, selecting meaningful measures, and addressing missing data and patient/caregiver involvement. The discussion emphasizes the importance of combining PRO measures with traditional outcome measures, the need for more research on long-term PROs in high-grade glioma patients, and the potential benefits of using PROs in survivorship care to improve communication, symptom management, and quality of care.
