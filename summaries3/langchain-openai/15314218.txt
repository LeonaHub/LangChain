The text discusses a study on the stability and folding of apomyoglobin (apoMb), particularly focusing on the I form of apoMb, which is a partly folded intermediate state. The study investigates the effects of substitutions at position 131 on the stability of both the I form and the native form of apoMb. The results suggest that the stability of the I form is primarily influenced by hydrophobic interactions rather than specific side-chain packing interactions. Overpacking substitutions at position 131 stabilize the I form, indicating a lack of rigid side-chain packing interactions in this region. In contrast, underpacking substitutions destabilize the I form. The study also examines the effects of these substitutions on the native form of apoMb, revealing multistate unfolding transitions and suggesting that the N form may exhibit structural plasticity at the level of side-chain packing. The findings provide insights into the structural dynamics and stability determinants of the I form of apoMb.
