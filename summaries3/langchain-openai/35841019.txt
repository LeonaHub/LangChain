The project aims to implement the HIGHway intervention, which focuses on advance care planning (ACP) for dialysis patients, in collaboration with various stakeholders. The intervention involves training social workers/nurses in ACP using a holistic approach and a computer application to guide the process. Stakeholder engagement is crucial throughout the project, with a focus on patient and provider outcomes. Data collection methods include surveys, audits of ACP conversations, and qualitative interviews. The implementation timeline spans over two years, with a focus on successful adoption and use of the ACP approach. The project aims to address barriers to ACP implementation and make it a routine part of dialysis care.
