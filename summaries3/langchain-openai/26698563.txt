The text discusses a rare case of a hepatic falciform ligament clear cell myomelanocytic tumor (CCMMT), which is a type of perivascular epithelioid cell tumor. The case involves a 29-year-old woman with liver cancer rupture, leading to surgical intervention. Various imaging studies, including ultrasound, CT scans, and MRI scans, were conducted to diagnose the tumor. The patient underwent surgery for tumor excision, and the pathological examination revealed characteristics of CCMMT. The text details the microscopic and immunohistochemical features of CCMMT, differential diagnoses, biological behavior, treatment options, and prognosis. It also highlights the importance of long-term follow-up and potential targeted therapies using mTOR inhibitors. The study emphasizes the rarity of CCMMT and the need for further research and clinical trials to improve diagnosis and treatment outcomes.
