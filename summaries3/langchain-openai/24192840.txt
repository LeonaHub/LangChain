The text discusses tandem repeats (TRs) in DNA sequences, which are motifs containing adjacent repeating units. TRs are found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, with microsatellites (1-6 bp) and minisatellites (10-100 bp) being the two main categories. TRs are highly mutable and can be associated with genetic diseases in humans and detrimental phenotypes in plants. The text describes a study that analyzed TRs in 31 plant and green algal species using genome sequence data. The study found that TR densities varied among species and regions, with no significant correlation between TR density and genome size. TR motifs were influenced by GC content, with different motifs preferred in different regions. TR distribution profiles showed biases towards gene ends and intron regions, suggesting potential roles in gene regulation. The study highlights the need for further research to understand the evolutionary trends and biological functions of TRs in plants and green algae.
