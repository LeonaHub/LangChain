The paper discusses the Complexity Account of Treatment Efficacy in the context of treating lexical semantic deficits in individuals with fluent aphasia. It explores semantic complexity within the organization of semantic categories and the relevance of semantic complexity to the treatment of naming deficits in aphasia. The discussion includes the distinction between typical and atypical examples within categories, the influence of typicality on access to category items, and the application of typicality hierarchies in treatment. The paper presents theoretical frameworks on the representation of semantic categories and the impact of typicality on lexical access. It also delves into the factors influencing treatment outcomes, such as patient variables, stimulus/task-specific variables, and the treatment protocol. The study highlights the importance of selecting typical and atypical examples, controlling for semantic features, and engaging in focused semantic processing activities during treatment. The paper concludes by emphasizing the clinical relevance of generalization to untrained items and the potential for further research on semantic complexity in the treatment of lexical semantic deficits in aphasia.
