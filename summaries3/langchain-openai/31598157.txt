The text discusses a study on the association between two MAGE-A11 gene SNPs (rs6641352 and rs6540341) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) risk and survival. The study involved a case-control and cohort study, genetic analysis, and survival analysis. Results showed that both SNPs were associated with an increased risk of RCC, with rs6641352 also impacting RCC survival. The study highlighted potential interactions between these SNPs and RCC risk factors. The study suggests that these intronic SNPs may play a role in RCC tumorigenesis, although further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms.
