The text discusses a retrospective cohort study conducted at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital in Australia, focusing on patients who underwent ileostomy formation procedures. The study aimed to analyze factors associated with readmission within 60 days of discharge following ileostomy formation. Results showed a high readmission rate of 38%, with dehydration being a common cause. The study found a significant decrease in renal function following ileostomy formation, with no significant differences at the time of ileostomy closure between readmission and no readmission groups. Serum sodium levels were associated with an increased risk of readmission, likely due to the risk of AKI. The study highlights the need for further research to preserve renal function in all patients with an ileostomy.
