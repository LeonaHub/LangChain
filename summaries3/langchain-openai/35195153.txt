The study aimed to evaluate the expression of epithelial growth factors, apoptosis-regulating proteins, and cell proliferation markers in periapical granulomas (PGs) and periapical cysts (PCs) at different stages of development. The research found that CD57+ cells were present in approximately half of the lesions, with a greater presence in lesions with moderate/intense inflammatory infiltrates. Bcl-2 expression did not vary significantly based on inflammatory infiltrates or epithelial lining type. EGF and KGF expression were more common in PCs than in PGs, with KGF showing greater expression in small PCs. EGFR expression did not correlate with any parameters evaluated. Ki-67 expression was limited in the epithelial lining of PCs, with no significant differences among the groups studied. The study suggests that EGF, KGF, and CD57+ cells may influence the development of IPLs, with KGF potentially playing a role in the initial stages of PC development.
