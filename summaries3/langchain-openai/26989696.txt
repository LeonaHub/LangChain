The text discusses the potential role of curcumin in protecting against diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), a complication of diabetes characterized by structural and functional cardiac disorders. Studies have shown that diabetes increases cardiomyocyte apoptosis and oxidative stress, contributing to DCM. Curcumin, a compound with antioxidant properties, has been found to reduce cardiomyocyte apoptosis and oxidative stress induced by high glucose levels. It inhibits apoptosis by regulating the Bcl-2/Bax ratio and decreases ROS generation by inhibiting NADPH oxidase. Additionally, curcumin activates the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3Î² signaling pathway, which plays a role in cell survival and cardiac function. Overall, curcumin shows promise as a potential therapeutic agent for DCM by protecting against high glucose-induced cardiac injury through its antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects.
