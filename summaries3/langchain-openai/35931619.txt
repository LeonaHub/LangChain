The text discusses the importance of wound monitoring and evaluation in the healing process, emphasizing the need for systematic assessment using measurement instruments. It describes the development and validation of a Portuguese version of the RESVECH 2.0 scale for assessing chronic wounds. The study involved cultural and linguistic adaptation, reliability testing, and validity testing. Results showed good internal consistency, agreement between raters, and validity in relation to other wound assessment scales and quality of life measures. The study highlighted the impact of factors like BMI on wound healing and emphasized the scale's potential for clinical use in wound management. Further research is recommended to explore the scale's psychometric properties in different settings.
