The study investigated the impact of asthma on Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) expression in peripheral blood and sputum leukocytes. Thirty-three newly-diagnosed asthmatics and 19 healthy subjects were analyzed, with asthmatics showing lower sTLR2 levels in serum and sputum compared to controls. RT-PCR confirmed reduced TLR2 mRNA expression in asthmatic sputum leukocytes. The findings suggest that the asthmatic lung's humoral and cellular environment may down-regulate TLR2 expression. Further research is needed to determine the clinical implications of decreased sTLR2 in asthma severity.
