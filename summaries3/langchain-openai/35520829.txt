The text discusses the synthesis of colloidal solutions of silver sulfide quantum dots in heavy water (D2O) and their stability over a long period. The study involved the use of sodium citrate as a stabilizing agent to prevent the aggregation of the quantum dots. Various analytical techniques such as dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and energy dispersive analysis were employed to characterize the synthesized quantum dots. The results showed that the quantum dots ranged in size from 3 to 19 nm with a monoclinic structure. The study demonstrated that the colloidal solutions in heavy water maintained stability and small quantum dot size even after extended storage, making them suitable for further structural studies using small-angle neutron scattering. The differences in quantum dot size between heavy water and ordinary water synthesis were attributed to the properties of the dispersing medium.
