The text discusses primary Sj√∂gren's syndrome (pSS), a systemic autoimmune disease affecting exocrine glands, leading to dry eyes and mouth. Non-pharmacological interventions for pSS were explored in five randomized controlled trials, focusing on activities of daily living, participation outcomes, and impairment of body functions and structures. However, the studies had methodological limitations, including high risk of bias, small sample sizes, and poor reporting quality. The interventions such as punctal plugs showed some effectiveness, but overall, the evidence for non-pharmacological treatments in pSS was inconclusive. Further research with well-designed trials and relevant outcome measures is recommended to improve the quality of life for individuals with pSS.
