The text discusses the risk assessment and management implications of Pine Wilt Disease (PWD) caused by the Pine Wood Nematode (PWN) in China. A comprehensive risk assessment framework was developed to evaluate the introduction pathways, establishment, and dispersal risks of PWN. The study identified multiple introduction pathways for PWN in China, highlighting the importance of strict quarantine regulations for imported pine wood products. The research also examined the interactions between PWN, its insect vectors (M. alternatus and M. saltuarius), and host Pinus species under current and future climate conditions. The results indicated potential geographical shifts and increased threats posed by PWN in high-latitude regions due to climate change. The study emphasizes the need for enhanced early warning, prevention measures, and biological control strategies to manage the risks associated with PWN in China.
