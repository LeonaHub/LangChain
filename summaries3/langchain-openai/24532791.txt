The text discusses the characterization of Vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1) and its paralog, VKORC1L1, focusing on their membrane topology, enzymatic activity, and active site regeneration mechanisms. VKORC1 is a three-TMD membrane protein responsible for reducing vitamin K epoxide, while VKORC1L1 is a four-TMD protein with conserved loop cysteines in the ER lumen. VKORC1L1 efficiently supports vitamin K-dependent carboxylation and requires its loop cysteines for active site regeneration. The study suggests that VKORC1L1's overall structure, rather than specific sequences, determines its unique reaction mechanism compared to VKORC1. The findings highlight the evolutionary differences between VKORC1 and VKORC1L1 and suggest that VKORC1L1 may have distinct physiological functions.
