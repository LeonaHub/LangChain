The text discusses the evolution of the definition of pain by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) and the recent efforts to revise it. The IASP Subcommittee on Taxonomy recommended the current definition in 1978, but in recent years, there have been calls for a re-evaluation due to advances in understanding pain. A Presidential Task Force was formed in 2018 to evaluate the definition, leading to a 2-year deliberation process. Feedback from the global pain community was sought, resulting in revisions to the definition and accompanying notes. The revised definition emphasizes pain as a personal experience influenced by biological, psychological, and social factors, while distinguishing it from nociception. The text highlights the importance of recognizing different types of pain, including nociplastic pain, and the potential benefits of the new definition for research and patient care. The final recommendations were unanimously approved by the IASP Council, aiming to reflect ongoing progress in the field of pain research and care.
