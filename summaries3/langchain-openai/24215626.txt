The text discusses a systematic review on the effects of supplementing infant formula with probiotics Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 (B lactis) and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) on the growth of healthy infants. The review includes studies on weight gain, length gain, head circumference gain, and BMI, with a focus on early infancy. The findings suggest that B lactis supplementation does not significantly impact growth compared to unsupplemented formula. Limited data on LGG supplementation make it difficult to draw conclusions on its effects on infant growth. The review highlights methodological limitations, such as small sample sizes and short follow-up periods, emphasizing the need for caution in interpreting the results. Further research is recommended to explore the potential impact of probiotic supplementation on infant growth.
