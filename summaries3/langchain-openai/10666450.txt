The text discusses the characterization of the gut-enriched Kr√ºppel-like factor (GKLF) transcription factor, highlighting its role in regulating proliferation and differentiation in epithelial and endothelial tissues. GKLF contains zinc fingers and acidic amino acid clusters crucial for its transactivation and growth-suppressing abilities. The study demonstrates that GKLF's transactivation involves intermolecular interactions and requires the co-activators p300/CBP. GKLF physically interacts with CBP, and mutations affecting the acidic residues in GKLF abolish its transactivation, protein interaction, and growth-suppressing effects. This study provides insights into the complex mechanisms underlying GKLF's transcriptional regulation and biological activities.
