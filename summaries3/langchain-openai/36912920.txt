The text discusses the treatment of popliteal cysts through arthroscopic techniques, focusing on a study that assessed the recurrence rate and functional outcomes of a cyst wall and valve excising arthroscopic technique. The study included 97 patients with a mean follow-up of 39 months. Results showed a low recurrence rate of 12.4% assessed by ultrasonography, with good functional outcomes. Severe chondral lesions were associated with an increased risk of cyst recurrence. The study adds valuable insights into the importance of addressing concomitant intra-articular pathologies in popliteal cyst treatment. Overall, arthroscopic treatment of popliteal cysts was found to be effective in reducing recurrence and improving functional outcomes.
