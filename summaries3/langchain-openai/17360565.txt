The text discusses the molecular mechanisms involved in FOXP3-mediated transcriptional repression in regulatory T cells. It highlights the association of FOXP3 with HAT TIP60 and HDAC7 and HDAC9 in a dynamic ensemble, essential for transcriptional regulation. The study identifies the N-terminal 106-190 aa region of FOXP3 as critical for transcriptional repression and its association with HAT/HDAC complexes. Knockdown of endogenous TIP60 relieves FOXP3-mediated repression, indicating the importance of TIP60 in the repression complex. The study also explores the effects of TCR stimulation on FOXP3-HDAC9 interaction and the role of HDAC activity in regulating FOXP3 complex stability. The findings suggest potential pharmaceutical approaches to modify regulatory T cell functions by altering HAT/HDAC enzymatic activities. Experimental procedures involving human CD4+CD25+ T cells, cloning of FOXP3 cDNAs, preparation of nuclear extracts, and luciferase assays are detailed in the text.
