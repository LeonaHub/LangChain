The study aimed to develop a new pulp capping material by incorporating bismuth oxide and calcium hydroxide into Portland cement. The physical properties of the new material were evaluated, including setting time, compressive strength, diametral tensile strength, and push out bond strength. Results showed that the addition of bismuth oxide and calcium hydroxide affected the setting time, compressive strength, and push out bond strength of the material. Portland cement with bismuth oxide had the highest push out bond strength, while the addition of 10 wt% calcium hydroxide produced a material with acceptable physical and adhesive properties. The study suggests that this modified Portland cement could be a potential alternative to mineral trioxide aggregate for pulp capping applications.
