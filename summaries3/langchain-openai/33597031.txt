The text discusses a study on the 5-year outcomes of endoscopic nasopharyngectomy for recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (rNPC) in North America. The study included 13 patients who underwent salvage endoscopic nasopharyngectomy. The results showed a 5-year overall survival rate of 84.6% for patients with rT1 and rT2 staged rNPC, with favorable complication rates. Patients with lower rStages had higher disease-free rates, and early cStages were associated with improved overall prognosis. The study highlights the importance of close surveillance and prompt management of recurrences for long-term tumor control.
