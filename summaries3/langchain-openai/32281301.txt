The text discusses a study on the use of PET/CT imaging to evaluate the treatment response and prognosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients who underwent neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) followed by surgery. The study focused on the usefulness of the Positron Emission Tomography Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (PERCIST) and FDG PET/CT parameters in predicting treatment response and prognosis in PDAC patients. The study included 22 patients who underwent PET/CT before and after NAT, with findings indicating that PERCIST and SUVmax were superior to RECIST in determining treatment response. The reduction rate of metabolic tumor volume (MTV) was identified as an independent prognostic factor for recurrence and survival in PDAC patients. The study highlights the importance of PET/CT parameters in predicting treatment response and prognosis in PDAC patients who undergo NAT followed by surgery.
