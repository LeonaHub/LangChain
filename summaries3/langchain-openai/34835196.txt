The text discusses the development of a double-antibody sandwich ELISA method for detecting the MCP antigen concentration in inactivated Infectious Spleen and Kidney Necrosis Virus (ISKNV) vaccines. The study involved generating mouse monoclonal antibodies against ISKNV, purifying the virus, and expressing the MCP protein. The ELISA method showed high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in detecting antigen concentrations in the vaccines. The assay's linear range was 4.69-300 ng/mL, with a sensitivity of 0.9 ng/mL. The ELISA was effective in correlating antigen content with viral titers in inactivated vaccines, providing a reliable tool for evaluating vaccine quality.
