The study investigated the role of circRNA 0079993 (circ_0079993) derived from the POLR2J4 gene in colorectal cancer (CRC). The research found that circ_0079993 was significantly upregulated in CRC tissues and cell lines, correlating with poor prognosis. Knockdown of circ_0079993 inhibited CRC cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Circ_0079993 acted as a sponge for multiple miRNAs, including miR-203a-3p.1, and regulated the expression of CREB1 by sponging miR-203a-3p.1. The study highlighted the complex regulatory networks involving circ_0079993, miRNAs, and CREB1 in CRC progression, suggesting potential therapeutic targets and the need for further investigation into the functional mechanisms of circ_0079993 in CRC.
