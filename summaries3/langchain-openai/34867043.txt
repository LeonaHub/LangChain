The text discusses the chemopreventive effects of metformin (MET) in an in vivo rat model of breast carcinogenesis induced by 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo[p]dioxin (TCDD). The study explores the role of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and its regulated genes in breast cancer initiation and the potential protective mechanisms of MET. Results show that MET treatment inhibits AhR activation, reduces expression of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1, induces apoptosis, inhibits cell cycle proliferation, and reduces oxidative DNA damage in rat breast tissues exposed to DMBA. Additionally, MET inhibits mammosphere formation in MCF-7 cells, suggesting a potential role in reducing breast cancer stem cells. The study highlights the chemopreventive properties of MET through modulation of the AhR/CYP1A1 pathway and its potential as a safe and effective agent for breast cancer prevention. Further studies on enzymatic activities of target proteins are recommended to validate the findings.
