The text discusses the challenges and biases in studying gene gain and loss through tree reconciliation methods in comparative genome sequencing. It explains how errors in gene tree reconstruction can lead to biases in inferring duplications and losses, particularly on non-informative branches of the species tree. The bias results in an overestimation of ancient duplications and recent losses. The text also highlights the impact of incomplete lineage-sorting on the placement of duplications and the potential for biases in inferring whole genome duplications. It suggests improvements in reconciliation methods and emphasizes the need for caution in interpreting results related to gene gain and loss in vertebrate genome evolution studies.
