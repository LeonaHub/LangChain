The text discusses the prevalence of rabies in Ghana, particularly focusing on the incidence of animal bites and the administration of rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) at Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital. The study reviewed data from 1030 patients who received PEP between 2013 and 2016. Findings revealed that children were most affected by animal bites, with dogs being the primary source of bites. Delays in initiating PEP were observed, with males more likely to delay treatment. The study highlighted the importance of enforcing dog vaccinations and educating the public, especially children, on avoiding animal bites to prevent human rabies. Limitations included self-reported data and the need for follow-up studies to assess rabies incidence post-PEP. Overall, the study emphasized the significance of public health interventions to eliminate rabies deaths in Ghana.
