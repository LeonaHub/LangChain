The text discusses the potential therapeutic efficacy of FTY720 in treating NK-cell leukemia, focusing on its mechanisms of action in inducing apoptosis in leukemic NK cells. The study found that FTY720 triggered caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death in leukemic NK cells by degrading the prosurvival protein Mcl-1 through a lysosomal pathway, rather than a proteosomal pathway. Additionally, FTY720 altered sphingolipid metabolism, leading to increased levels of proapoptotic sphingosine in leukemic NK cells. The study also demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of FTY720 in a rat model of aggressive NK-cell leukemia, resulting in complete remission in some animals. Furthermore, the combination of FTY720 and nanoliposomal ceramide showed synergistic effects on inducing apoptosis in leukemic NK cells, suggesting potential for combined therapies in NK-cell leukemia treatment.
