Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis (IPH) is a rare disorder in children characterized by recurrent diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. The condition presents with a triad of hemoptysis, iron deficiency anemia, and pulmonary infiltrates. The study reviewed 107 pediatric IPH cases over 21 years, highlighting the challenges in diagnosis due to variable clinical presentations. Laboratory tests, chest imaging, and examination for hemosiderin-laden macrophages aid in diagnosis. Glucocorticoids are the main treatment, but recurrence is common. Early recognition and appropriate treatment are crucial for improving prognosis in IPH.
