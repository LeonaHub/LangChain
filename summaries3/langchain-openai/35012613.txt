The text discusses a study conducted in Norway to investigate breast cancer subtypes among immigrant groups using national health data from 2005 to 2015. The study included over 1.6 million non-immigrant women and 310,000 immigrant women aged 20-75 years. The findings revealed that immigrants from Eastern Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia had lower incidence of the luminal A-like subtype, while immigrants from Asia had higher rates of HER2+ tumors. TNBC rates were similar across immigrant groups, except for women from South-East Asia who had a lower rate. The study highlights the importance of considering immigrant status or country of birth in understanding cancer outcomes, as differences in tumor characteristics among immigrant groups are influenced by various factors such as genetics, lifestyle, and healthcare practices. These findings are crucial for developing tailored preventive and screening strategies for different immigrant populations.
