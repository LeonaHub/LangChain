The text discusses the impact of low-dose ethanol exposure on neonatal mice, focusing on the role of G9a, histone modifications, and neurodegeneration. It highlights how ethanol-induced activation of G9a leads to increased dimethylation of H3K9 and H3K27, potentially contributing to mild neurodegeneration. The study demonstrates that pharmacological inhibition of G9a activity with Bix prevents the ethanol-induced histone modifications and rescues neurodegeneration. The findings suggest that G9a, DNMT3A, and MeCP2 form a repressive complex, and their dysregulation by ethanol may affect gene expression during early brain development. The study underscores the importance of chromatin structure alterations in ethanol teratogenesis and the potential for pharmacological interventions to mitigate these effects in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD).
