The text discusses the impact of electronic component failures in engine management on vehicle performance and emissions. Research findings show that malfunctions in components like the crankshaft position sensor, injector, and ignition coil can lead to a significant decrease in engine power and increased exhaust emissions. Some failures, like the oxygen sensor and throttle position sensor, may not be immediately noticeable to the driver but can result in excessive emissions. Proper functioning of these components is crucial for maintaining optimal engine performance and emission levels. Recommendations include incorporating measures in legislation to activate warning indicators for serious faults and emphasizing regular vehicle maintenance to prevent excessive emissions and ensure road safety.
