The study focused on evaluating the potential antitumor activity of Amblyomin-X in pediatric anaplastic ependymoma (EPN) primary culture and an intracranial xenograft model. EPN cells were characterized and treated with Amblyomin-X, temozolomide, and cisplatin, showing selective cytotoxic effects on EPN cells without affecting normal cells. Flow cytometry and ultrastructural analysis confirmed apoptosis induction in EPN cells by Amblyomin-X. In vivo experiments using a xenograft model demonstrated tumor regression with Amblyomin-X treatment, as evidenced by MRI and histological analysis. The study highlights the potential of Amblyomin-X as a promising therapeutic agent for EPN.
