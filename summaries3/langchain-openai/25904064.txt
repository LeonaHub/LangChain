The text discusses the application of Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI IMS) for visualizing biomolecules in tissue. It explains the challenges in identifying proteins in MALDI IMS experiments and the strategies used for protein identification, including bottom-up, top-down, and indirect identification methods. The text highlights the limitations of traditional MALDI TOF platforms and the advantages of using MALDI FTICR MS for high-resolution and high-accuracy protein imaging. It presents a case study demonstrating the use of MALDI FTICR IMS to identify and study modified forms of the protein S100A8 in kidney tissue infected with Staphylococcus aureus. The study showcases the ability of MALDI FTICR IMS to provide detailed molecular information and spatial distribution of proteins in biological tissues, enhancing our understanding of host-pathogen interactions and protein modifications in infection biology.
