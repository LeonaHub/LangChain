The text discusses the association between the MTHFR gene polymorphisms, particularly C677T, and the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It highlights the impact of elevated homocysteine levels due to MTHFR enzyme deficiency on DNA damage and neurotransmitter imbalance, contributing to neurodegenerative disorders like AD. The study conducted meta-analyses and meta-predictive analyses to explore the gene-environment interactions, specifically with air pollution, in relation to AD risk. The findings showed a significant association between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and AD risk, with varying effects across different geographic regions. The use of big data analytics, GIS maps, and advanced techniques helped visualize and analyze the complex relationships between gene mutations, air pollution, and AD risks. The study suggests that environmental factors, such as air pollution, may play a role in the development of AD and calls for further research to understand the epigenetic mechanisms involved in AD pathogenesis.
