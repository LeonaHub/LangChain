The text discusses a study on the effects of Trypsin-Chymotrypsin preparation (Chymoral Forte D.S.) on burn patients, focusing on the modulation of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1Î² and IL-6. The study involved administering the drug to burn patients and analyzing changes in serum cytokine levels, clinical parameters, and wound healing outcomes. Results showed that the drug treatment led to a decrease in cytokine levels, reduced burn oedema, accelerated wound epithelialization, and improved scar outcomes compared to untreated control cases. The study highlights the potential of Trypsin-Chymotrypsin in managing burn injuries and suggests further investigation into anti-inflammatory cytokine expression during treatment. Acknowledgments were given to individuals and organizations that supported the research.
