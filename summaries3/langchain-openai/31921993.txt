The University of Vermont Larner College of Medicine developed a film and discussion curriculum to address medical student mistreatment from the perspective of educators, residents, nurses, and staff. The curriculum aimed to stimulate discussions on the role of learners in creating a positive learning environment and included teaching points for both students and faculty. Evaluation data showed that the film resonated with viewers, leading to increased understanding and potential behavior changes. The curriculum facilitated intergenerational dialogue and highlighted the shared responsibility for a positive learning environment. While positively assessed, further research is needed to assess long-term impacts, and future projects may include representing the perspectives of patients and families.
