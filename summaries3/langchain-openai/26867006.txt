The text discusses the impact of diameter distribution on charge transport in polydisperse semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) networks. The study uses near-infrared electroluminescence as a sensitive measure to analyze the distribution of carriers within mixed nanotube networks. The results show that the transport paths in these networks are non-uniform and strongly influenced by the energy level distribution of the nanotubes. The study highlights that the presence of small bandgap nanotubes leads to preferential transport through them, even if they are a minority within the network. The findings suggest that narrow diameter distributions are more suitable for achieving maximum on-currents in field-effect transistors (FETs) with a given network density. Additionally, the availability of pure semiconducting and monochiral dispersions allows for the design of tailored SWNT networks, leading to optimized device performance at a lower cost.
