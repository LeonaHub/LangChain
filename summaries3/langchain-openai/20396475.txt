The text discusses the potential neuroprotective effects of indole β-carbolines and R-(-)-deprenyl against neuronal cell injury induced by nitrogen species, particularly in the context of Parkinson's disease. The study conducted experiments using differentiated PC12 cells treated with S-nitroso-N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine (SNAP) to investigate the impact of these compounds on cell viability, mitochondrial membrane permeability, cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation, ROS formation, and glutathione depletion. The results suggest that β-carbolines and R-(-)-deprenyl can mitigate the cytotoxic effects of SNAP by inhibiting mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, potentially offering neuroprotection against neuronal cell death. The study highlights the potential therapeutic value of these compounds in mitigating neurodegenerative processes associated with Parkinson's disease.
