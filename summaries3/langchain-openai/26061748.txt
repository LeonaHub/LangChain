The study focused on identifying potential therapeutic agents for Group 3 medulloblastomas using the Connectivity Map (C-MAP) database. Through gene expression analysis and C-MAP queries, compounds such as piperlongumine (PL) and alsterpaullone (ALP) were identified as promising candidates for treating medulloblastomas. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated the efficacy of these compounds in reducing cell proliferation and tumor growth in Group 3 medulloblastoma models. ALP, a CDK inhibitor, was particularly effective in targeting cell cycle-related genes, including MYC, and inducing apoptosis. Gene expression analysis and GSEA further supported the mechanism of action of ALP in medulloblastoma cells. The study highlights the potential of ALP as a targeted therapy for Group 3 medulloblastomas and underscores the value of chemical genomics in drug discovery for pediatric brain tumors.
