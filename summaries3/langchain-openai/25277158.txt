The text discusses the prevalence and impact of postnatal depression (PND) on mother-infant relationships, emphasizing the importance of early interventions to prevent long-term consequences on child development. It introduces a study aiming to evaluate the effectiveness of a brief mother-infant intervention, HUGS, for women with PND. The study will use a randomized controlled trial (RCT) methodology with primary outcomes focusing on the quality of mother-infant interactions and maternal reports of parenting stress. The HUGS program includes psychoeducation and intervention sessions to improve mother-infant interactions, while the control group receives an attention placebo playgroup. The study aims to address deficits in previous research and provide a cost-effective, easily implementable intervention to support mother-infant relationships and prevent long-term negative outcomes.
