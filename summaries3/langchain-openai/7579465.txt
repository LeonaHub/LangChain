The text discusses the activation of the src-related tyrosine kinase lyn in human neutrophils in response to various soluble and particulate agonists. The activation of lyn leads to an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation, which plays a role in the signal transduction mechanisms of neutrophils. The study utilized immune kinase assays, in situ 32P-labeling techniques, and immunoblotting to demonstrate the activation of lyn and its association with tyrosine phosphorylation. The specificity of lyn activation was shown through phosphoamino acid analysis, indicating a preference for tyrosine residues. The activation of lyn was observed with different types of receptors and agonists, suggesting its pivotal role in neutrophil responses. The study highlights the complexity of signaling pathways and the need for further research to understand the specific mechanisms involved in neutrophil responses to different agonists.
