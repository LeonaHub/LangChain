The text discusses an analysis conducted as part of the HPTN 052 study, focusing on predictors of adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV-1 infected individuals who were offered treatment for HIV prevention. The study involved HIV-1 serodiscordant couples in multiple countries and utilized various measures such as adherence questionnaires, pill counts, and psychosocial interviews. Results showed high levels of adherence to ART, with mental health scores being a significant predictor of adherence. The study also highlighted the importance of evidence-based counseling, feedback on viral suppression, and clear communication of prevention benefits in promoting adherence to ART for HIV prevention. The findings suggest that implementing these approaches in clinical settings could help optimize adherence to ART for HIV prevention.
