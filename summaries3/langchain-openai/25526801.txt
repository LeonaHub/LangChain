The text discusses the molecular modeling, docking simulations, and mutagenesis studies of RGD-hirudin, a thrombin inhibitor derived from the leech. The study focused on the interaction between RGD-hirudin and thrombin, identifying key residues involved in binding and inhibiting thrombin activity. Mutant variants were created and tested for anti-thrombin activity and binding affinity using surface plasmon resonance analysis. Results indicated that specific residues in RGD-hirudin play a crucial role in its interaction with thrombin. The study provides insights into the structural basis of RGD-hirudin's mechanism of action and suggests potential applications in developing new oral antithrombin peptides for combating thrombotic diseases. Further research is recommended to explore additional mechanisms of interaction and binding between RGD-hirudin and thrombin.
