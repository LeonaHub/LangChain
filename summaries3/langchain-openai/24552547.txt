The text discusses a study that investigated the effects of the environmental chemicals BPA and genistein on the rat serum proteome, aiming to identify potential biomarkers of susceptibility to breast cancer. The study utilized TMT-MS to analyze protein expression in rats exposed to BPA and genistein during the prepubertal period. The results showed differential expression of various proteins associated with carcinogenesis and chemoprevention in the rat serum following exposure to these chemicals. Western blot analysis validated the TMT-MS findings, confirming altered expression of specific proteins. The study highlights the potential of quantitative proteomics via TMT-MS as a reliable technique for identifying molecular targets and biomarkers of susceptibility to environmental chemical exposures. The findings provide insights into the mechanisms of action of BPA and genistein in breast cancer development and prevention. Further research is needed to explore the altered protein expression in mammary gland tissues and to compare these findings with human studies.
