The text discusses the impact of nandrolone decanoate (ND) treatment on the expression of aquaporin 1 (Aqp1) and aquaporin 9 (Aqp9) in different segments of the rat epididymis. The study involved treating male Sprague Dawley rats with ND at different doses for 2 or 12 weeks and analyzing the expression levels of Aqp1 and Aqp9 using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The results showed differential modulation of Aqp1 and Aqp9 expression in various epididymal segments by ND treatment, suggesting segment-specific and dose-dependent regulation. The study also highlighted the complex regulatory mechanisms of Aqp1 and Aqp9 in the epididymis by hormonal factors and suggested that aberrant expression of these aquaporins by ND treatment could impact sperm development and potentially lead to ND-induced infertility. Further research is recommended to explore the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying these effects.
