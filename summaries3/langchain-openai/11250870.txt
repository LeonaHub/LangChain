The text discusses a study on the neurogenic control of arterial tone in rat mesenteric arteries of different sizes. The study aimed to compare the roles of P2X receptors and Î±-adrenoceptors in mediating vasoconstriction and to investigate the involvement of calcium channels and calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) in smooth muscle contraction. The findings revealed that the purinergic component dominates in small-medium arteries, while large arteries are primarily adrenergic. Calcium influx through P2X receptors was found to be the main mechanism of contraction, with little contribution from L-type calcium channels or CICR. The study suggests that P2X receptors could be potential targets for hypertension treatment.
