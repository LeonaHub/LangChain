The text describes a study on a new β-chain variant in congenitally abnormal fibrinogen Ise, characterized by delayed release of fibrinopeptide B due to a single amino acid substitution of cysteine for glycine at Bβ 15. The study involved various analyses including coagulation studies, purification of fibrinogen, fibrin monomer polymerization studies, Bβ-chain digestion with lysylendopeptidase and thrombin, amino acid sequence analysis, and polymerization studies of des-AB fibrin monomers. The findings suggest the positive role of Bβ-chains in fibrin clot formation by thrombin, with the NH2-terminus of β-chain inhibiting the binding of the NH2-terminus of α-chain to its binding site. The study also highlights the importance of using a high concentration of thrombin for analyzing abnormal fibrinogens with defective release of fibrinopeptides.
