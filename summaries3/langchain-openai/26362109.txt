The text discusses the structural and mechanistic advances in bacterial nitrate reductases, focusing on membrane-bound and periplasmic nitrate reductases. Crystallographic studies have revealed the coordination of molybdenum and sulfur ligands in the active sites of these enzymes, leading to a revised understanding of the reaction mechanisms involved. The S-shift mechanism, where the substrate binds directly to the Mo atom, has been proposed based on structural and theoretical evidence. These findings highlight the importance of detailed structural analysis and technological advancements in X-ray crystallography for understanding the function of these enzymes in the cellular nitrogen cycle. Despite significant progress, there are still challenging opportunities for further research on nitrate reductases.
