The text discusses a study that aimed to investigate the impact of intrinsic motivation (IM) on cognitive recovery in individuals with schizophrenia through motivational instructional techniques in a computer-based arithmetic learning program. The study compared a motivation-enhanced arithmetic program with a standard arithmetic program and a non-trained subsample. Results showed that the motivation-enhanced program led to greater improvements in arithmetic skills, intrinsic motivation, perceived self-competency, and attention compared to the standard program. The motivational group also completed the sessions in less time and showed higher treatment attendance. The study highlights the importance of incorporating motivational strategies in cognitive remediation programs for individuals with schizophrenia to enhance learning outcomes.
