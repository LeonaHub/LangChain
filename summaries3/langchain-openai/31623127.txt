The text discusses the development and characterization of a new generation of magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) known as MCP 3 for Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI). MCP 3 was synthesized using a modified coprecipitation method and coated with carboxymethyl dextran sodium salt for stabilization. Various characterization techniques, including TEM, DLS, and MPS, were used to assess the properties of MCP 3. The results showed that MCP 3 exhibited strong MPS signal amplitudes and superior MPI characteristics compared to the standard tracer ResovistÂ®. Phantom studies demonstrated higher sensitivity, selectivity, and spatial resolution with MCP 3, making it a promising candidate for future in vivo MPI studies. The study highlights the potential of MCP 3 as a high-performance MPI tracer synthesized using the coprecipitation method.
