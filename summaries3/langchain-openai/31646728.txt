The text discusses the importance of patient and family advisory councils (PFACs) in engaging patients in healthcare system design and quality improvement efforts. It highlights a qualitative study that investigated the expectations of patients who are not PFAC members regarding these councils. The study conducted focus groups with participants from a specific healthcare organization to understand their views on who should be on a PFAC, how it should be comprised, and how it should connect back to patients. The findings suggest that patients expect PFACs to communicate bidirectionally with both patients and healthcare organizations, be diverse and inclusive, and demonstrate impact on healthcare delivery. Recommendations include increasing awareness of PFACs, ensuring diversity in membership, facilitating communication channels, and evaluating effectiveness. The study emphasizes the potential for PFACs to improve patient-centered care and enhance patient trust in healthcare systems.
