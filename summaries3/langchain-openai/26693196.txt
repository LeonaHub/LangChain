The text discusses a study conducted at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Ghana to assess the level of awareness and knowledge of glaucoma among patients aged forty years and above. The study found that awareness of glaucoma was high at 74%, with higher education being the only socioeconomic factor associated with increased awareness. However, despite high awareness, knowledge about glaucoma was low and there were misconceptions about its symptoms. The study highlights the need for increased awareness programs with a focus on educating patients and targeting lower socioeconomic populations to improve knowledge and understanding of glaucoma for early detection and treatment. Further community-based studies are recommended to evaluate awareness and knowledge of glaucoma in the general population.
