The study introduced a novel CLEC-2 Y7A knockin mouse model that maintained the surface expression of a signaling-dead CLEC-2 receptor. This model displayed a defect in blood-lymph separation, similar to constitutive CLEC-2 knockout models, indicating the importance of CLEC-2 signaling in preventing lymphatic blood-filling. The Y7A mutation abolished platelet responses to CLEC-2 agonists but did not affect CLEC-2 expression or major signaling proteins. The study revealed that CLEC-2 contributes to thrombus stability independently of hemITAM signaling, as shown by destabilized hemostasis and thrombosis in response to blocking the CLEC-2 ectodomain. Further research is needed to identify the signaling-independent adhesive role of CLEC-2 in thrombosis and hemostasis.
