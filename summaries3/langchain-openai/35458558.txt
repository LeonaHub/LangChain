The text discusses the investigation of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility in various animal species using in vitro and ex vivo primary cell culture models. The study examined the mRNA expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL in the respiratory tracts of different mammalian species and evaluated their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results showed that dogs supported viral replication, while ferrets did not, and cows showed limited replication. The study highlighted the importance of alternative receptors and the complexity of viral entry mechanisms. The limitations of cell culture models in replicating in vivo conditions were also discussed. Overall, the research emphasizes the need for further studies to identify potential intermediate hosts and reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 while minimizing animal experimentation.
