The text discusses the issue of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and its impact on public health, particularly focusing on the ESKAPE pathogens group. The study conducted in a Romanian infectious diseases hospital from 2016 to 2020 analyzed bacterial isolates and their antibiotic resistance profiles. The ESKAPE pathogens were predominant, with varying levels of resistance observed in different bacterial species. The study highlighted challenges in microbiological diagnosis, limited data on AMR progression, and the need for improved surveillance and adherence to international standards. The findings underscore the importance of recognizing and addressing AMR to guide antibiotic prescription practices and enhance control measures.
