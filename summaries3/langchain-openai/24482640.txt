The text discusses a study conducted to assess neutrophil apoptosis in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hemodialysis (HD) patients, as well as the influence of granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) on neutrophil apoptosis. The study involved 59 patients from a research institute in Egypt, including those with ESRD on regular hemodialysis and CKD patients on conservative treatment, along with healthy controls. Various investigations were performed, including routine tests, neutrophil isolation, apoptosis assays, CD18 expression analysis, and ICAM-1 determination. Results showed increased inflammatory markers, accelerated neutrophil apoptosis, and enhanced neutrophil activation in CKD and HD patients. The addition of GM-CSF delayed neutrophil apoptosis and improved cell viability in both patient groups. The study suggests that GM-CSF may have a therapeutic benefit in reducing the severity of bacterial infections in CKD and HD patients. Further in vivo studies are recommended to explore the clinical implications of GM-CSF in enhancing resistance to infections in these patient populations.
