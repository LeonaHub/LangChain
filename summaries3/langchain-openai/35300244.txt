Aortic intramural haematomas (AIH) are thrombosed aortic dissections that typically affect older females with cardiovascular risk factors, often involving the descending aorta. Diagnosis is typically done through computed tomography (CT), which provides important prognostic information. Treatment options include medical therapy for stable patients and thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) for those with complications. TEVAR aims to exclude the entry tear and re-expand the true lumen, but complications such as aortic dissection, migration, and endoleak can occur. Careful patient selection and monitoring are crucial, as preemptive TEVAR in uncomplicated AIH may not always be beneficial. Regular CT follow-up is essential due to the potential for complications such as aortic dissection.
