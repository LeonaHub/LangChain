The text discusses the welding process of high-strength steel sandwich panels using flux bands constricting arc (FBCA) welding method in ultra-narrow gap grooves. The study focuses on the impact of flux bands on arc behavior, arc shape, arc heat, and arc stability in comparison to traditional gas metal arc welding (GMAW). The flux bands, which decompose at high temperatures, have a solid-wall constricting effect on the arc, influencing its burning position, shape, and heat distribution. The FBCA welding process with flux bands results in a more stable arc, increased effective heating area, and improved arc stability compared to GMAW. The flux bands regulate the heat of the arc, affecting side-wall penetration and overall weld quality. The study concludes that flux bands effectively enhance arc stability in ultra-narrow gap welding processes.
