The study focused on identifying genetic mutations as predictors of prognosis in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and determining appropriate indications for lobectomy (LT) based on genetic markers. The research analyzed data from 685 PTC patients, revealing that TERT promoter mutations were significantly associated with worse outcomes, while BRAF V600E mutations alone did not impact survival significantly. Patients without TERT promoter mutations with 1-4 cm intrathyroidal PTC showed favorable outcomes with LT compared to total thyroidectomy (TT). The study suggests that genetic markers can guide the initial surgical approach for PTC patients, potentially reducing overtreatment and complications.
