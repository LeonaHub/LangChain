The text describes a study involving the development and evaluation of a COVID-19 vaccine using an adenovirus vector expressing the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 with an autophagy-inducing peptide (AIP-C5) in mice and golden Syrian hamsters. The study involved immunogenicity assessments, including humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, as well as virus neutralization assays against different SARS-CoV-2 variants. The vaccinated animals were then challenged with SARS-CoV-2 to evaluate protection efficacy through measures such as morbidity, virus titers, and lung pathology. The study also involved histopathological analysis of lung samples and virus load quantification. The results indicated that the vaccine induced robust immune responses and provided protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the animal models.
