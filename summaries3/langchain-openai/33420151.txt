The study investigated the association between bacterial conjunctivitis, acute otitis media, and acute bacterial paranasal sinusitis in children, focusing on the etiology, clinical features, and antibiotic susceptibility patterns. A total of 67 children were included, with H. influenzae being the most common pathogen identified. The study found a significant link between these three infections, suggesting a "conjunctivitis-otitis media-sinusitis syndrome" with a shared pathogenic process. The study highlighted the high amoxicillin-clavulanate resistance rate of H. influenzae, especially in girls. The findings suggest the need for effective vaccines against non-typeable H. influenzae infections and the importance of considering this syndrome in clinical practice. The methods included bacterial culture sampling from conjunctiva and ear discharge, with antimicrobial susceptibility testing conducted according to CLSI guidelines. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA, t-tests, and chi-square tests.
