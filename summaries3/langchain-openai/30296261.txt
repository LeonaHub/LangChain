The text discusses a study on the chronic oral toxicity effects of the neonicotinoid pesticide clothianidin on queen, worker, and male bumblebees. The study found that queens and males were more vulnerable to clothianidin toxicity compared to workers. Additionally, the study explored the genomic response of workers and males to sub-lethal doses of clothianidin, identifying 332 clothianidin-sensitive genes associated with various biological functions. While workers and males responded similarly to clothianidin exposure, differences were observed in the expression of detoxification genes, suggesting potential differences in detoxification capacity. The study highlights the importance of considering queen and male survival in pesticide risk assessments and suggests the use of genomic approaches to assess neonicotinoid exposure levels and their impact on wild bee populations.
