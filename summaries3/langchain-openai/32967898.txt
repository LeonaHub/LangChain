The text discusses the use of Virena software and Sofia influenza A+B FIA for tracking influenza cases in outpatient clinics across the Los Angeles area. The study aimed to predict influenza surges in the emergency department (ED) by analyzing outpatient influenza data. Results showed that the number of positive influenza cases in the outpatient setting preceded an influx of cases in the ED, providing an early warning sign. The study highlighted the potential of using outpatient influenza data to predict ED activity, enabling timely infection prevention measures and resource allocation. Limitations included lack of demographic data and the need for ongoing evaluation and adjustments. Future directions include expanding to include other respiratory viruses like RSV for enhanced community spread monitoring.
