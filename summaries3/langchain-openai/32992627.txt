The text discusses the investigation of the renal toxicity of InP/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) with various surface modifications in BALB/c mice. The study involved characterizing the QDs, administering them to mice, and analyzing their effects on kidney function through various parameters such as biochemical indicators, histopathological changes, inflammatory responses, oxidative stress markers, and apoptosis pathway alterations. The results showed that different surface modifications of the QDs led to varying levels of toxicity, with hydroxylated and amino-modified QDs exacerbating renal damage through apoptosis and oxidative stress, while carboxylic-modified QDs primarily caused renal damage via oxidative stress. The study highlights the importance of surface modifications in reducing QD toxicity for potential biomedical applications.
