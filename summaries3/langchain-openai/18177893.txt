The text discusses the identification and characterization of the cadmium-responsive genes cdr-1, cdr-4, and cdr-6 in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. These genes encode integral membrane proteins expressed in intestinal cells and are involved in defense against cadmium toxicity. While cdr-1 is induced specifically by cadmium, cdr-4 responds to multiple metals, and cdr-6 is constitutively expressed. The genes share structural similarities and contain post-translational modification sites. Their expression patterns in intestinal and pharyngeal cells suggest potential roles in osmoregulation and material transport. Inhibition of cdr-4 and cdr-6 expression leads to fluid accumulation in nematodes, indicating a disruption in osmoregulation. However, their response to hypertonic stress suggests they may not be directly involved in osmoregulation. Further studies are needed to elucidate the precise biological functions and regulatory mechanisms of the CDR gene family in C. elegans and other organisms.
