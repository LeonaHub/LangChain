The study focused on examining the renal consequences of prolonged hyperglycemia in nonobese GK rats to understand the similarities to human diabetic nephropathy. The research revealed that GK rats exhibited functional and morphological progression in the kidneys, including glomerulosclerosis, mesangial cell proliferation, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and inflammatory cell infiltration, similar to human diabetic nephropathy. The expression of Î±-SMA and type IV collagen increased in GK rats, along with macrophage infiltration, indicating abnormal matrix production and pathogenesis of renal lesions. These changes were not observed in age-matched Wistar rats, suggesting that prolonged hyperglycemia, rather than aging or obesity, plays a crucial role in inducing progressive diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetes.
