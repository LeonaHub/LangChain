The text describes a study conducted to investigate the mechanism of resistance of the pecan scab pathogen, Venturia effusa, to the demethylation-inhibiting (DMI) fungicide tebuconazole. The study involved field sensitivity evaluations of V. effusa to DMI fungicides, in vitro sensitivity assays, determination of resistant isolates, sequencing and analysis of the CYP51A and CYP51B genes, and gene expression analysis. The results revealed novel mutations in the CYP51A and CYP51B genes, as well as increased gene expression among resistant isolates. The study also discussed the implications of fungicide resistance in V. effusa and the importance of further research for effective scab control in pecan orchards.
