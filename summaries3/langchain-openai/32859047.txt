The study investigated the effects of heart failure on the gut-blood barrier and the levels of trimethylamine (TMA) and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) in rats with heart failure. The research found that heart failure led to structural and functional changes in the intestinal wall, resulting in increased levels of TMA and TMAO in the plasma. These alterations were associated with disturbances in tight junction proteins, reduced intestinal blood flow, and morphological changes in the intestines. The study suggested that the increased gut-to-blood penetration of TMA in heart failure may be a marker and mediator of cardiovascular pathology. Various measurements, analyses, and evaluations were conducted, including metabolic and hemodynamic measurements, histopathological evaluations, ELISA tests, RNA isolation and RT-qPCR, protein extraction and immunoblotting analysis. Statistical analyses were performed to assess differences between the experimental groups.
