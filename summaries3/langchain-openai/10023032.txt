The study investigated the effects of insulin-induced hypoglycemia (IIH) on LH secretion and the activity of the GnRH pulse generator in estrogen-primed OVX rats. It was found that IIH suppressed pulsatile LH secretion by decreasing the electrical activity of the GnRH pulse generator. Glucose administration was able to recover the suppressed activity of the GnRH pulse generator, indicating a critical role of glucose in maintaining GnRH neuron activity. Other carbohydrates like fructose, galactose, xylose, and lactate did not have the same rapid effect as glucose, suggesting a unique role of glucose in synaptic function. Mannose behaved similarly to glucose, possibly due to its ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. The study concluded that glucose availability, rather than just metabolic state, is essential for maintaining the electrical activity of the GnRH pulse generator and pulsatile LH secretion.
