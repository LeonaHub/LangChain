The text discusses the prevalence of heavy drinking among college students, particularly focusing on mandated students who violate alcohol policies. It highlights the importance of interventions to address alcohol-related issues among college students and the effectiveness of brief motivational interventions (BMIs) and skills-based interventions in reducing alcohol consumption and related consequences. The study evaluates the effectiveness of a University Assistance Program (UAP) modeled after Employee Assistance Programs in reducing alcohol consumption, heavy episodic drinking, blood alcohol concentration, alcohol-related consequences, coping skills, and use of protective behaviors among mandated students. The results show that UAP was more effective than services as usual in reducing weekday alcohol consumption, alcohol-related consequences, and increasing coping skills and use of protective behaviors. However, there were no significant differences in total weekly alcohol consumption, heavy episodic drinking, or blood alcohol concentration between UAP and services as usual. The study suggests the need for further research on tailoring interventions to mandated students' risk profiles and violations history to improve outcomes related to alcohol use.
