The text discusses the correlation between Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and fragility fractures in elderly patients, particularly those over 60 years old. A systematic review was conducted, including various studies that assessed the association between T2DM and fragility fractures, such as hip, vertebral, and non-vertebral fractures. The review found that the majority of studies supported the increased risk of fragility fractures in elderly patients with T2DM. Factors contributing to this increased risk include hyperglycemia, AGEs accumulation, inflammatory cytokines, impaired bone turnover, and vascular supply issues. The review also highlighted the importance of considering specific fracture risk factors in T2DM patients, adjusting FRAX scores, and utilizing appropriate diagnostic tools like TBS measurement. Treatment considerations for osteoporosis in T2DM patients were also discussed, emphasizing the need for further research in this area. Ultimately, the text underscores the importance of recognizing bone fragility as a complication of T2DM, especially in elderly patients, and the necessity for tailored diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for this specific patient group.
