The text discusses Haldane's Rule, which states that when one sex of hybrid offspring between different animal races is absent, rare, or sterile, it is always the heterogametic sex. Various explanations for this rule include dominance theory, the "Large X-effect," and accelerated evolution on sex chromosomes. Studies in birds have shown patterns consistent with Haldane's Rule, with lower introgression rates for maternally inherited loci and Z-linked loci compared to autosomal loci. However, the underlying mechanisms, such as reduced fitness of female hybrids, are not always directly confirmed. The text highlights the importance of combining genomic data with field observations to understand introgression patterns and the role of the W-chromosome in Haldane's Rule. Future research should focus on estimating local introgression rates across the genome and studying the W-chromosome to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying Haldane's Rule.
