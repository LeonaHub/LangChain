The text discusses the characterization of the IFNL4 gene, a noncanonical member of the type III interferon family, which exhibits unique regulatory properties compared to canonical interferons. The study investigates the low expression of IFNL4 mRNA in response to viral infection and the functional differences in the IFNL4 promoter compared to canonical IFN promoters. Various experiments, including luciferase assays, ChIP assays, and promoter chimera constructions, were conducted to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of the IFNL4 gene. The study also explores the evolutionary conservation of the IFNL4 promoter and its distinct regulatory features across mammalian species. The findings suggest that the IFNL4 gene is regulated in a unique manner, different from canonical IFNs, and its low expression in response to viral infection may be a conserved feature among mammals.
