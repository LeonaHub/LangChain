The text discusses the flaws in the research conducted by Mast et al. regarding the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the coagulation cascade in the lung. The study used datasets from other studies for comparison, but issues were identified with the control group samples, library preparation methods, and sequencing depth. These issues led to unreliable differential expression analysis and conclusions that contradicted findings from other studies. The text emphasizes the importance of adhering to quality control standards in research and the need for transparent reporting of data. The study's conclusions were found to be fundamentally flawed, and the text suggests that future research should be based on more reliable data sets.
