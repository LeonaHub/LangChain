The text discusses the relationship between primary and secondary metabolism in Streptomyces bacteria, focusing on the role of TAG metabolism in triggering antibiotic biosynthesis. The study analyzed the proteomes of wild-type and ppk mutant strains of S. lividans TK24, identifying proteins involved in glycolysis, lipid metabolism, phosphate regulation, nitrogen metabolism, and iron acquisition. The ppk mutant showed increased expression of enzymes related to TAG degradation, leading to the production of acetyl-CoA, a precursor for antibiotic biosynthesis. The study also highlighted the upregulation of Pho regulon genes and the downregulation of iron acquisition proteins in the ppk mutant. The findings suggest that an energetic deficit triggers TAG degradation, providing precursors for antibiotic biosynthesis. The study provides a novel understanding of the link between primary and secondary metabolism in Streptomyces and offers insights into antibiotic production mechanisms.
