The study investigated the association between COVID-19 and the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients undergoing testing for VTE in a healthcare system in Sweden during the initial months of the pandemic. The study included a cohort of 8702 patients who underwent diagnostic tests for VTE, with no significant difference in VTE prevalence between 2020 and 2015-2019. COVID-19 infection was not associated with an increased risk of VTE, and patients with COVID-19 had a lower prevalence of VTE compared to those without COVID-19. The study suggests that COVID-19 status should not significantly influence the pretest probability for VTE in emergency department settings. Further research is recommended to confirm these findings.
