The text discusses the presence of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) such as Nε-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML), Nε-(carboxyethyl)lysine (CEL), and acrylamide in plant-based meat analogs (PBMA). These compounds are formed during Maillard reactions and can have detrimental health effects. The study investigated the contents of CML, CEL, and acrylamide in 15 commercially sold PBMA and explored factors influencing their formation, including protein, amino acids, sugars, and fatty acids. The results showed varying levels of CML, CEL, and acrylamide in PBMA, with correlations found between these compounds and certain ingredients. The study also highlighted the importance of ingredient selection and processing methods to reduce the formation of these harmful compounds in PBMA.
