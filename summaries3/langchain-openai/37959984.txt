The study focused on the long-term outcomes of polymeric vascular grafts made of poly-Îµ-caprolactone (PCL) implanted in rat abdominal aortas for 180 days. Three main histological reactions were observed: graft encapsulation, chronic inflammation, and scaffold degradation with remodeling and vitalization. Intimal hyperplasia and subintimal mineralization were common in all implants. Grafts without inflammation remained stable and patent, while those with inflammation were stenotic. The study highlights the importance of cell differentiation in remodeling artificial vascular prostheses and the need for further research to understand these processes.
