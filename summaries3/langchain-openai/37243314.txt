The text discusses a study on the impact of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals on the circadian clock and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in THP-1 macrophages, a model for gout flares. The study found that MSU crystals altered the expression of circadian clock components, with increased PER2 and CRY1 and reduced BMAL1 and REV-ERBα levels. Both BMAL1 and REV-ERBα repressed MSU crystal-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Time-of-day variations were observed, with BMAL1 levels influencing the susceptibility to inflammasome activation. The findings suggest that the circadian clock may contribute to the nocturnal risk of gout flares by affecting immune cell function in response to MSU crystals.
