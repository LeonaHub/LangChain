The study focused on the clinical acceptability of crowns made by dentists in routine practice, with a remake rate of 3.8%. Factors such as dentist experience, practice busyness, and private insurance status were associated with crown success. Patients receiving crowns tended to be educated and had a mean age of 55 years. The study highlighted the diverse reasons for crown rejection, with proximal misfit and marginal errors being common causes. The findings suggested that more experienced clinicians had lower remake rates, while those who took more time with crown procedures had more satisfactory outcomes. Limitations included subjective evaluation of crown acceptability and potential bias due to the study design. The study concluded that dentist and practice characteristics, as well as patient demographics, played a role in crown success rates.
