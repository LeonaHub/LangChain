The study focused on evaluating the prognostic role of various molecular tissue biomarkers in bladder cancer patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. The research involved analyzing markers such as survivin, CD68, CLEVER-1, MAC387, KRT5, KRT20, ERBB2, and BIRC5 through immunohistochemistry and RT-qPCR. The results indicated that high levels of survivin and BIRC5 were associated with better outcomes in MIBC patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. Additionally, macrophage infiltration was linked to worse survival outcomes, particularly in tumors with high proliferative activity or elevated ERBB2 expression. The study highlighted the potential of these markers in predicting chemotherapy benefit and the importance of further prospective studies to validate these findings. The combination of immunohistochemical and molecular methods could aid in better patient selection for specific therapeutic interventions in clinical practice.
