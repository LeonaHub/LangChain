The study focused on investigating the dietary vitamin A (DVA) intake, serum vitamin A (SVA) concentrations, and breast milk vitamin A (BMVA) concentrations of urban lactating Chinese women. Data was collected from 326 women in ten cities in China, and various analyses were conducted to explore the associations among DVA, SVA, and BMVA. The study found that only a small proportion of lactating women met the recommended nutrient intake (RNI) for vitamin A, with meat and eggs being the primary dietary sources. While SVA levels were adequate, nearly one-fifth of women had BMVA levels below the recommended threshold. Overweight or obese women had lower DVA intake and BMVA concentrations but higher SVA concentrations. Multiparous women were at a higher risk of inadequate BMVA. Positive associations were found between higher SVA and BMVA with DVA intake. The study highlighted the importance of maternal dietary intake in maintaining adequate vitamin A levels in breast milk and the need for further research on factors influencing vitamin A status in lactating women.
