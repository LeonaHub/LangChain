The text discusses a study conducted in Seoul, South Korea, using data from the 2017 Seoul Survey to examine the association between companion animal ownership and overall life satisfaction. The study found that pet ownership was positively associated with higher levels of overall life satisfaction. Dog owners were the most common, followed by cat owners, and those owning both dogs and cats reported the highest satisfaction levels. Single pet owners had higher satisfaction than those with two or more pets. The study used propensity score matching to establish causal relationships and found that pet ownership positively impacted overall life satisfaction. However, the study had limitations, such as a cross-sectional design and small sample sizes for certain pet ownership categories. Despite these limitations, the study provides valuable insights into the relationship between pet ownership and human well-being, advocating for further research in this area.
