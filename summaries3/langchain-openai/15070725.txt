The text discusses the role of Arg-522 in the T7 replicative DNA helicase encoded by bacteriophage T7. The study involved genetically altered gene 4 proteins, gp4-R522A and gp4-R522K, where Arg-522 was substituted with alanine or lysine. The results showed that the altered proteins had significantly decreased dTTPase activities compared to the wild-type gene 4 protein. The study also found that the altered proteins exhibited uncoupling of dTTP hydrolysis and DNA unwinding activities, with gp4-R522A losing the ability to unwind DNA and gp4-R522K showing reduced unwinding. The inability of Vi to inhibit dTTP hydrolysis catalyzed by the altered proteins suggested an interaction between Vi and the gene 4 protein that was lost in the absence of Arg-522. The study concluded that Arg-522 plays a crucial role in coupling dTTP hydrolysis and DNA unwinding activities in the T7 gene 4 helicase.
