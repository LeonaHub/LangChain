The text discusses the challenges and considerations in the management of recurrent endometrioma, particularly focusing on the use of dienogest as a long-term therapy post-surgery. The study conducted retrospectively on 203 patients who underwent laparoscopic or robotic surgery for ovarian endometrioma and subsequent treatment with dienogest. The results showed a low recurrence rate of 1.5% with dienogest therapy, with minimal side effects such as irregular bleeding, constipation, and weight gain. Patients who continued dienogest had a significantly lower discontinuation rate, and the therapy was well-tolerated. The study highlights the potential of dienogest as a safe and effective long-term therapy for preventing recurrence of ovarian endometrioma, with further research needed to determine its efficacy in different patient populations and age groups.
