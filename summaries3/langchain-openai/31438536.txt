The text describes a research study focused on the identification and functional characterization of a novel invertase inhibitor protein, Zm-INVINH4, in maize under drought stress conditions. The study involved various experimental procedures, including genome-wide screening, cloning, plasmid construction, gene expression analysis, protein extraction, enzyme activity determination, plant transformation, and confocal microscopy analysis. The results indicated that Zm-INVINH4 inhibits both cell wall and vacuolar invertase activities in maize sink tissues, leading to sucrose accumulation under drought stress. The study provides insights into how Zm-INVINH4 modulates invertase-related source-to-sink growth and development in maize, particularly under drought conditions, with potential implications for improving productivity and mitigating drought-induced seed abortion in maize. Statistical analysis was conducted using a Student's t-test for the experimental data.
