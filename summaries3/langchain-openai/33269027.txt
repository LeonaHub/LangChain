The text discusses a study on preeclampsia, a pregnancy-specific syndrome, focusing on lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as a potential marker for the condition. The study involved 60 pregnant women, with 30 having preeclampsia and 30 as controls. Results showed a significant elevation of serum LDH in preeclampsia, with differences between mild and severe cases. LDH isoenzyme profiles indicated a decrease in aerobic forms in preeclampsia, suggesting a shift due to hypoxia. The study suggests LDH, along with isoenzyme distribution, could be a robust predictor of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, aiding in risk assessment and management. Limitations include the study design and sample size, warranting further validation. Acknowledgments were given to individuals and institutions involved in the study.
