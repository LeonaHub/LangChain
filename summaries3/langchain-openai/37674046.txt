The study focused on the application of three-dimensional electrical body surface mapping in cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) to assess RV and LV activation patterns and their impact on CRT response measures. The research demonstrated that RV-specific and LV-specific assessments of electrical activation after CRT were more predictive of response outcomes than traditional measures like QRS duration. The study highlighted the importance of consistent RV and LV activation rates, the association between delayed RV activation and RV dysfunction, and the impact of pacing strategies on clinical response. The findings suggest that three-dimensional mapping can guide CRT pacing strategies and predict response measures based on electrical activation patterns. The study provides valuable insights into the complexity of CRT response and its associations with RV function and electrical activation.
