The text discusses a study on gene expression analysis of heterosis in chickens, a topic that has not been extensively explored in livestock species. The study compared gene expression in F1 crosses and their parental lines, focusing on embryonic brain and liver samples at day 12. The research aimed to examine the heterosis effect on embryo weight and identify transgenerational gene expression patterns. The findings revealed a predominant additive gene expression pattern, with dominance and over-dominance patterns also observed. Functional analysis highlighted genes related to tissue development, immunity, and metabolism. The study suggested that trans-acting regulatory mechanisms may play a significant role in differential gene expression and heterosis in chickens. Further research in different tissues and developmental stages is recommended to gain a comprehensive understanding of heterosis in chickens.
