The text discusses a study on the use of transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) paired with notched music therapy for treating refractory chronic tinnitus in patients. The study included 30 patients with subjective tinnitus and assessed the effects and safety of tVNS using a patch-type electrode. The treatment sessions resulted in improvements in subjective tinnitus loudness and awareness scores, with 50% of patients reporting symptom relief. The study highlighted the importance of tinnitus duration in predicting treatment efficacy and emphasized the safety of tVNS when applied correctly. Further research with control groups and objective measures is recommended to confirm the effectiveness of this therapeutic approach.
