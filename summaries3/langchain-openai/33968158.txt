The text discusses the role of PAR2 (Protease-Activated Receptor 2) in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and its association with promoter methylation. It highlights the significance of PAR2 in cancer progression, particularly in LUAD, where high expression and hypomethylation of PAR2 are observed. The study utilizes bioinformatics analysis, cell culture experiments, and molecular assays to investigate the impact of PAR2 promoter methylation on LUAD cell behavior. Results indicate that hypomethylation of the PAR2 promoter leads to increased PAR2 expression, promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in LUAD. The study suggests that targeting PAR2 promoter methylation could potentially serve as a therapeutic strategy for LUAD. Future research aims to further validate specific methylated sites and enhance understanding of PAR2 as a therapeutic target in LUAD.
