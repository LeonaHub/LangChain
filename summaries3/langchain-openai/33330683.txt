The text discusses a study that aimed to evaluate the selectivity of water buffaloes for four tree species commonly used in silvopastoral systems: Leucaena leucocephala, Albizia lebbeck, Gliricidia sepium, and Moringa oleifera. The study was conducted in Cuba, and clinically healthy female water buffaloes were used in the experiment. The animals were treated with ivermectin, and the study took place in a tropical, seasonally humid climate. The animals were fed a diet consisting of tree leaves and other supplements, and their consumption and preferences were measured. The results showed variations in leaf consumption, with A. lebbeck and L. leucocephala being the most consumed, while M. oleifera and G. sepium were consumed less. The study also analyzed the chemical composition of the leaves and their contribution to the animals' diet. The findings suggest that L. leucocephala and A. lebbeck were preferred by the buffaloes, potentially due to feeding memory and ease of consumption. The study provides insights into buffaloes' preferences for different tree leaves and suggests further exploration of the effects of secondary metabolites on feed intake.
