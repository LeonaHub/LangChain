The text discusses the importance of peer-led interventions in schools and the effectiveness of selecting influential individuals as peer change agents. It explores various theoretical methods for selecting peer leaders, such as Peer Opinion Leaders, Friendship Network Opinion Leaders, Key Players, and Hybrid Methods. The study evaluates the sociometric and demographic characteristics, clustering, representativeness, and proximity to at-risk students of peer leader sets produced by these methods. It also examines the relationship between selection concordance and intervention diffusion in schools. The findings suggest that network-informed selection methods can improve the diversity and network position of peer leader sets, potentially enhancing intervention diffusion. The study concludes that a hybrid approach combining respected opinion leaders and strategically placed key players may offer the best potential for intervention diffusion in school settings.
