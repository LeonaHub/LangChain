The text discusses the impact of intense and prolonged exercise on cardiac remodeling in high-performance athletes, particularly focusing on the role of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) as a potential biomarker for adverse cardiac changes. The study evaluated sVCAM-1 levels in long-distance runners before and after a marathon race and assessed its association with left atrial (LA) remodeling. Results showed that highly trained athletes had elevated sVCAM-1 levels and significant changes in cardiac remodeling compared to moderately trained and non-active individuals. The study suggests that sVCAM-1 may be a predictor of atrial remodeling and potential risk of atrial fibrillation in high-performance athletes, highlighting the need for further research in this area.
