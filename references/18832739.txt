Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) are a heterogeneous group of cells that play a critical role in tumor associated immune suppression. In an attempt to identify a specific subset of MDSC primarily responsible for immunosuppressive features of these cells, 10 different tumor models were investigated. All models showed variable but significant increase in the population of MDSC. Variability of MDSC expansion in vivo matched closely the effect of tumor-cell condition media (TCCM) in vitro. MDSC consists of two major subsets of Ly6G+Ly6Clow granulocytic and Ly6G-Ly6Chigh monocytic cells. Granulocytic MDSC have increased level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and undetectable level of nitric oxide (NO) whereas monocytic MDSC had increased level of NO but undetectable levels of ROS. However, their suppressive activity per cell basis was comparable. Almost all tumor models demonstrated a preferential expansion of granulocytic subset of MDSC. We performed a phenotypical and functional analysis of several surface molecules previously suggested to be involved in MDSC mediated suppression of T cells: CD115, CD124, CD80, PD-L1, and PD-L2. Although substantial proportion of MDSC expressed those molecules no differences in the level of their expression or the proportion, positive cells were found between MDSC and cells from tumor-free mice that lack immune suppressive activity. The level of MDSC mediated T-cell suppression did not depend on the expression of these molecules. This data indicates that suppressive features of MDSC is caused not by expansion of a specific subset but more likely represents a functional state of these cells.
