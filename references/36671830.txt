The Astragalus subgenus Hypoglottis Bunge, which consists of several sections, is one of the taxonomically most complicated groups in the genus. The Astragalus section Stereothrix Bunge belongs to this subgenus and is a significant element of the Irano-Turanian floristic region. A molecular phylogenetic analysis of this section and its closely related taxa using nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacers (ITS) and external transcribed spacer (ETS) regions as well as plastid matK sequences were conducted. Parsimony analyses and Bayesian phylogenetic inference revealed that the section is not monophyletic in its current form, as some taxa belonging to closely related sections such as Hypoglottidei DC. and the Malacothrix Bunge group within the sect. Stereothrix render it paraphyletic. Moreover, species groups belonging to sect. Stereothrix are placed in different clades within the phylogenetic tree of subgenus Hypoglottis, which indicates polyphyly, i.e., multiple independent origins of taxa placed in the sect. Stereothrix. Molecular dating of the group estimated an age of 3.62 (1.73â€“5.62) My for this assemblage with the major diversification events happening during the last 2 My. Many species groups separated only within the last 0.5 to 1 My. Based on morphological and molecular data, we discuss the phylogenetic relationships of the groups and synonymy of species. In addition, the included taxa of sect. Hypoglottidei are not monophyletic and include species belonging to sects. Hololeuce, Koelziana, Malacothrix, Onobrychoideae, and Ornithodpodium group within the sect. Stereothrix taxa. We conclude that only an analysis including all groups and nearly all species of the sections within the Hypoglottis clade can finally result in an new evolutionary-based system for these taxa.
