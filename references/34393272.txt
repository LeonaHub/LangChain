The success of chemists in the fight against COVID-19 provides us with a unique opportunity for strengthening the position of chemistry in society and suppressing chemophobia which has badly affected the image and development of chemistry over several decades. By highlighting the unique merits of chemistry in controlling infections and healing diseases, we propose developing a communication strategy “Chemists as children of the Sun”. The time is ripe for chemists to take control of the story of chemistry. We believe that chemists must help the public to see chemistry in a whole new light. Only a positive perception of chemistry and the chemical profession will secure a sufficient supply of new talents, ideas, and also financial resources for the development of this unique and irreplaceable science for humanity.
