Mast et al. analyzed transcriptome data derived from RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of COVID-19 patient bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples, as compared to BALF RNA-seq samples from a study investigating microbiome and inflammatory interactions in obese and asthmatic adults (Mast et al., 2021). Based on their analysis of these data, Mast et al. concluded that mRNA expression of key regulators of the extrinsic coagulation cascade and fibrinolysis were significantly reduced in COVID-19 patients. Notably, they reported that the expression of the extrinsic coagulation cascade master regulator Tissue Factor (F3) remained unchanged, while there was an 8-fold upregulation of its cognate inhibitor Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI). From this they conclude that “pulmonary fibrin deposition does not stem from enhanced local [tissue factor] production and that counterintuitively, COVID-19 may dampen [tissue factor]-dependent mechanisms in the lungs”. They also reported decreased Activated Protein C (aPC) mediated anticoagulant activity and major increases in fibrinogen expression and other key regulators of clot formation. Many of these results are contradictory to findings in most of the field, particularly the findings regarding extrinsic coagulation cascade mediated coagulopathies. Here, we present a complete re-analysis of the data sets analyzed by Mast et al. This re-analysis demonstrates that the two data sets utilized were not comparable between one another, and that the COVID-19 sample set was not suitable for the transcriptomic analysis Mast et al. performed. We also identified other significant flaws in the design of their retrospective analysis, such as poor-quality control and filtering standards. Given the issues with the datasets and analysis, their conclusions are not supported.
