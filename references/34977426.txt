In vitro models fill a vital niche in preclinical pain research, allowing detailed study of molecular pathways, and in the case of humanised systems, providing a translational bridge between in vivo animal models and human patients. Significant advances in cellular technology available to basic pain researchers have occurred in the last decade, including developing protocols to differentiate sensory neuron-like cells from stem cells and greater access to human dorsal root ganglion tissue. In this review, we discuss the use of both models in preclinical pain research: What can a human sensory neuron in a dish tell us that rodent in vivo models cannot? How similar are these models to their endogenous counterparts, and how should we judge them? What limitations do we need to consider? How can we leverage cell models to improve translational success? In vitro human sensory neuron models equip pain researchers with a valuable tool to investigate human nociception. With continual development, consideration for their advantages and limitations, and effective integration with other experimental strategies, they could become a driving force for the pain field's advancement.
