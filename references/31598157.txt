Melanoma antigen-A11 (MAGE-A11) is a low-abundance, primate-specific steroid receptor coregulator in normal tissues of the human reproductive tract, which plays an important role in tumorigenesis. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been shown to contribute to cancer risk and prognosis. However, the role of SNPs of MAGE-A11 in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has not been established. Two intronic SNPs (rs6641352 and rs6540341) of MAGE-A11 have been screened to assess their associations with RCC risk and prognosis in a case control study. We found that rs6641352 was associated with RCC susceptibility in the dominant model (TC/CC vs. TT, adjusted odds ratio = 1.315, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.089-1.588) and with survival of RCC in the recessive model (CC vs. TT/TC, adjusted hazard ratio = 3.526, 95% CI = 1.072-11.595). For the SNP rs6540341, individuals with the T allele could have a critically increased risk of RCC (adjusted odds ratio = 1.301, 95% CI = 1.081-1.564, P = 0.005 in the dominant model). However, there was no significant association between rs6540341 and RCC survival. Hence, rs6641352 in MAGE-A11 may contribute to the genetic susceptibility and prognosis for RCC and act as a biomarker for RCC occurrence and prognosis.
