Gout is caused by monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition within joints. This leads to acute episodes of inflammation (“gout flares”) driven by NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages. Gout flares are frequently present during late night/early morning. The reason for this timing is unclear. Recent evidence suggests the NLRP3 inflammasome is under circadian control. The purpose of this study was to determine whether MSU crystals cause changes in the circadian clock in macrophages leading to time-of-day differences in NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Levels of circadian clock components were measured in undifferentiated “monocytic” and PMA-differentiated “macrophagic” THP-1 cells cultured with/without MSU crystals. Caspase-1 activity was measured to assess NLRP3 inflammasome activity. MSU crystal exposure resulted in minimal effects on clock genes in THP-1 monocytes but BMAL1, CRY1, PER2, and REV-ERBα showed altered expression with reduced protein levels of BMAL1 and REV-ERBα in THP-1 macrophages. REV-ERBα activation or BMAL1 over-expression resulted in reduced MSU crystal-induced caspase-1 activity. BMAL1 knockdown resulted in a further increase in MSU crystal-induced caspase-1 activity, but only at times of day when BMAL1 levels were naturally high. MSU crystal-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation was greatest at the time of day when BMAL1 levels were naturally low. MSU crystals alter the expression of circadian clock components in THP-1 macrophages leading to loss of BMAL1 and REV-ERBα-mediated repression of NLRP3 inflammasome activity and time-of-day differences in susceptibility to inflammasome activation. Our findings suggest that the nocturnal risk of gout flare is at least partially a consequence of altered circadian control of immune cell function.
