Introduction
In order to assess and to follow up the evolution of chronic wounds, it is advisable to apply measurement scales. This procedure allows clinicians to verify the appropriateness of their activities and whether the healing process is evolving as expected.

Aim
To conduct a cross-cultural adaptation and psychometric analysis of Portuguese version of RESVECH 2.0.

Methods
A quantitative and correlational study was designed and, to perform the cross-cultural adaptation of RESVECH 2.0, we followed the classic sequential approach for linguistic equivalence to European Portuguese. The study occurred at a Portuguese oncology hospital and the sample encompassed 281 patients with multiple chronic wounds.

Results
RESVECH 2.0 is a practical measurement instrument, easy to use, and well accepted by nurses to know all kinds of woundsâ€™ etiologies. The reliability test revealed an acceptable internal consistency and high proportion of agreement between two raters assessing the same patient.

Construct validity was considered average/good and the principal component factor analysis with varimax rotation obtained six factors corresponding to 59.5% of explained variance.

When comparing the domains from RESVECH 2.0 with those from BWAT we found statistically significant correlations.

Conclusion
The adapted version of RESVECH 2.0 scale presents a good internal consistency and is valid for the Portuguese language and culture, being useful and effective in clinical practice.
