Based on linkage between attention control, gaze and visuomotor control, previous studies suggested that quiet eye training (QET) could improve attention control. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of QET-based visuomotor intervention on different aspects of attention in children with ADHD. Fifty seven children with ADHD aged 9-12 years, were tested on focused, tonic and phasic attention, as well as attention control during a throwing task analysed via eye tracking, in pre- and post-test sessions, six weeks apart. The QET group that underwent specific 5-week QET-based intervention significantly increased focused attention including its accuracy aspect. Reaction times (RTs) and intraindividual RT variability under non-alert and alert conditions as measures of tonic and phasic attention did not change over time in either group. In contrast with the control (CON) group, an extended total time of eye fixations during the pre-throw and throw phase was found in the QET group after the intervention. The results of this study suggest that focused attention in children with ADHD can be improved by a short-term QET-based visuomotor intervention. Future research needs to examine the effects of a longer QET-based intervention, or the intervention in combination with other cognitive training of attention.
