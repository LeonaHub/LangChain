Mucosal surfaces are the first contact sites of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Most SARS-CoV-2 vaccines induce specific IgG responses but provide limited mucosal immunity. Cytokine B-cell activation factor (BAFF) and A proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily play key immunological functions during B cell development and antibody production. Furthermore, homeostatic chemokines, such as C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 13 (CXCL13), chemokine (Câ€“C motif) ligand 19 (CCL19), and CCL21, can induce B- and T-cell responses to infection and promote the formation of inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissues (iBALT), where specific local immune responses and memory cells are generated. We reviewed the role of BAFF, APRIL, CXCL13, CCL19, and CCL21 in the activation of local B-cell responses and antibody production, and the formation of iBALT in the lung following viral respiratory infections. We speculate that mucosal vaccines may offer more efficient protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection than systematic vaccines and hypothesize that a novel SARS-CoV-2 mRNA mucosal vaccine using BAFF/APRIL or CXCL13 as immunostimulants combined with the spike protein-encoding mRNA may enhance the efficiency of the local immune response and prevent the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 replication and the rapid viral clearance from the airways.
