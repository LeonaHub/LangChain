Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) is quite common in the environment. It can lead to a wide range of infections varying from simple boils to disseminated and metastatic infections. Disseminated multifocal MSSA infection without infective endocarditis is extremely rare. We report a case of a 48-year-old diabetic male who presented with complaints of back pain, lower limb weakness, urinary retention, and saddle sensation loss. His imaging showed an epidural abscess, spondylitis, multiple paraspinous abscess collections, iliopsoas and gluteal abscess formation, multiple abdominal abscesses, multiple cavitating lung nodules, left-sided empyema, and azygos venous thrombosis. He was managed with urgent laminectomy and evacuation of spinal epidural abscess. He was admitted under the medical team for further multidisciplinary patient care. Emergency physicians and internists should be able to recognize such cases early on to make appropriate management plans. Misdiagnosis and delay in treatment initiation can lead to high mortality and poor patient outcomes. Advanced imaging techniques should be utilized to avoid missed foci. Improved source control results in better patient outcomes.
