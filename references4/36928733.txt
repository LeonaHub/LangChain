Background
Myoepithelial neoplasms of the salivary gland are benign or malignant neoplasms composed exclusively of neoplastic myoepithelial cells. These tumors, including the benign myoepithelioma and the malignant counterpart myoepithelial carcinoma, exhibit a wide range of cytomorphologic features and architectural patterns.

Methods
Review.

Results
Myoepithelial cells can be epithelial, plasmacytoid, clear cell, spindle cell, and/or oncocytic cell, arranging as trabeculae, solid sheets, nests, cords, and/or single cells. A stromal component is commonly but not universally present, Therefore, their differential diagnoses are quite broad, including salivary gland neoplasms especially those with a myoepithelial component, plasmacytoma, melanoma, and various mesenchymal tumors.

Conclusion
In this review, we summarize the characteristic histologic features, useful immunohistochemical panel, and common molecular alterations of myoepithelial tumors and their top differential diagnoses. A logical stepwise algorithmic approach and an immunohistochemical panel to include multiple myoepithelial markers are essential to establish the correct diagnosis.
