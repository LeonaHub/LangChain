Surface texture measurement, characterized by areal parameters, is very susceptible to measurement errors. Various types of errors differently affect surface texture parameters. In this paper, two types of measurement errors were investigated. To analyze the impact of the presence of scratches, circular valleys of various diameters were added to surface textures measured by a white light interferometer. Measurement errors were larger for higher scratches. Skewness and kurtosis were mostly affected by the presence in valleys, and changes of spatial parameters were also comparatively high. The difference between the results of measurement of the same surface details two times after a break of three months was also studied. This difference was caused by errors of relocation, spikes and non-measured point presences, high-frequency noise, and surface ageing. Spatial parameters were found to be the most stable.
