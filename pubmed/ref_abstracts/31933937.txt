Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype. Our study investigated the functional role of DLC-3 in TNBC. The expression of DLC-3 was assessed by immunohistochemistry in TNBC to evaluate the clinicopathologic significance of DLC-3. Recombinant lentiviral vectors encoding the DLC-3 gene were constructed for transfection into MDA-MB-231. Real-time qPCR and western blot analysis were employed to evaluate the expression of DLC-3, β-catenin, GSK-3β and c-myc in DLC-3-transfected cells. Moreover, cell proliferation assays, cell colony formation assays, and cell migration and invasion assays were performed to elucidate the role of DLC-3 in TNBC development and progression. Our data revealed that DLC-3 was downregulated in TNBC, and its expression level was associated with lymph node status and differentiation grade in breast cancer. Both real-time qPCR and western blot analyses showed that the DLC-3 gene and protein were overexpressed in the DLC-3-transfected MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, the expression of GSK-3β was upregulated and the expression of β-catenin and c-myc gene was downregulated in the DLC-3-transfected cells. Furthermore, DLC-3 overexpression inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion in vitro. DLC-3, functioning as a tumor-suppressor gene, inhibits cell growth and invasion in TNBC, possibly through regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
