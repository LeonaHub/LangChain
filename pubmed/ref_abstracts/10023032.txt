We investigated the effect of glucose and its related substrates on the recovery of pulsatile luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion which was suppressed by insulin in estrogen-primed ovariectomized rats. We also examined the effect of glucose on the electrical activity of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulse generator which was suppressed by insulin. The intravenous (i.v.) injection of insulin (5 units/rat) suppressed the pulsatile LH secretion for 3 h in estrogen-primed ovariectomized rats. This suppressive effect of insulin on the LH secretion was rapidly reversed by the i.v. injection of glucose and mannose but not by the injection of lactate and saline. Fructose could recover the LH secretion suppressed by insulin, but took a longer time than glucose did. By monitoring the electrical activity of the GnRH pulse generator, we found that i.v. injection of insulin suppressed the pulsatile LH secretion by decreasing the activity of the GnRH pulse generator. Again, the i.v. injection of glucose, but not saline, immediately recovered the decrease in the electrical activity of the GnRH pulse generator. Fructose could recover the activity of the GnRH pulse generator, but it took a longer time than glucose did. We suggest that glucose availability, but not simply a metabolic state such as the ATP level, is an essential factor for maintaining the electrical activity of the GnRH pulse generator which is responsible for pulsatile LH secretion.
