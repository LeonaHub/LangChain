Objective
This study aimed to analyze the clinical characteristics and prognosis of pediatric idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis (IPH).

Methods
Pediatric IPH cases that were diagnosed at West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University between 1996 and 2017 were reviewed. Follow-up data from 34 patients were collected.

Results
A total of 107 patients were included (42 boys and 65 girls). The median age was 6 years at diagnosis. The main manifestations of the patients were as follows: anemia (n = 100, 93.45%), cough (n = 68, 63.55%), hemoptysis (n = 61, 57%), fever (n = 23, 21.5%), and dyspnea (n = 23, 21.5%). There were relatively few pulmonary signs. The positive rates of hemosiderin-laden macrophages in sputum, gastric lavage fluid, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were 91.66%, 98.21%, and 100%, respectively. Seventy-nine patients were misdiagnosed. A total of 105 patients were initially treated with glucocorticoids, among whom 102 survived and three died. Among the followed up patients, two died and 32 survived, among whom 10 presented with recurrent episodes.

Conclusions
The classic triad of pediatric IPH is not always present. The rates of misdiagnosis and recurrence of IPH are high. Early recognition and adequate immunosuppressive therapy are imperative for improving prognosis of IPH.
