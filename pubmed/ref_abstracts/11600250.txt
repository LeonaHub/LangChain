The present study was carried out in burn patients administered with Trypsin–Chymotrypsin (Chymoral Forte D.S.) preparation to observe if the acute-phase protein levels in the serum are modulated through the synthesis of IL-1β and IL-6 and if the severity of the inflammatory phase could be regulated. The effects of Trypsin–Chymotrypsin preparation on the modulation of cytokine levels particularly, IL-6 and IL-1β were analyzed in serum samples of 15 burn patients and compared with untreated controls. Significant differences in cytokine levels (P<0.05) were observed in untreated burn patients and Trypsin–Chymotrypsin preparation treated patients. There were significant variations in serum IL-6 and IL-1β on the day of admission and post burn day 10 in treated as well as untreated burn patients. Patients with a higher percentage of total body surface area and sepsis showed a significant increase in IL-1β and IL-6 in the serum. An increase in serum levels of both cytokines was observed on post burn day 1 and a significant decrease was observed in Trypsin–Chymotrypsin preparation treated patients on days 7 and 10. The possible role of the inflammatory cytokines in the pathophysiology of burns is discussed.
