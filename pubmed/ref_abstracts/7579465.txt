The functional responsiveness of human neutrophils is known to be initiated and modulated by protein tyrosine phosphorylation. The regulation of the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation is most likely the result of the coordinated actions of tyrosine kinases and phosphatases, which have so far been only very partially characterized. In the present study, we present evidence demonstrating that the stimulation of neutrophils by a variety of agonists (soluble as well as particulate) leads to the activation of the src-related tyrosine kinase lyn. The stimulation of tyrosine kinase activity of lyn was detected using an immune kinase assay as well as an in situ labeling technique. Phosphoaminoacid analysis of lyn indicated that the autophosphorylation of the kinase was exclusively on tyrosine residues. The time course of the activation of lyn is consistent with its playing a role in the early tyrosine phosphorylation responses of neutrophils. The ability of agonists with widely varying functional end responses to stimulate the activity of lyn indicates that this event plays a key and central role in the control of the activation of human neutrophils.
