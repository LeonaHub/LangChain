Spondweni virus (SPONV) is the closest known relative of Zika virus (ZIKV). SPONV pathogenesis resembles that of ZIKV in pregnant mice, and both viruses are transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. We aimed to develop a translational model to further understand SPONV transmission and pathogenesis. We found that cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) inoculated with ZIKV or SPONV were susceptible to ZIKV but resistant to SPONV infection. In contrast, rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) supported productive infection with both ZIKV and SPONV and developed robust neutralizing antibody responses. Crossover serial challenge in rhesus macaques revealed that SPONV immunity did not protect against ZIKV infection, whereas ZIKV immunity was fully protective against SPONV infection. These findings establish a viable model for future investigation into SPONV pathogenesis and suggest that the risk of SPONV emergence is low in areas with high ZIKV seroprevalence due to one-way cross-protection between ZIKV and SPONV.
