The influence of community diversity, which can be measured at the level of metabolic guilds, on community function is a central question in ecology. Particularly, the long-term temporal dynamic between a community's function and its diversity remains unclear. We investigated the influence of metabolic guild diversity on associated community function by propagating natural microbial communities from a traditionally fermented milk beverage diluted to various levels. Specifically, we assessed the influence of less abundant microbial types, such as yeast, on community functionality and bacterial community compositions over repeated propagation cycles amounting to âˆ¼100 generations. The starting richness of metabolic guilds had a repeatable effect on bacterial community compositions, metabolic profiles, and acidity. The influence of a single metabolic guild, yeast in our study, played a dramatic role on function, but interestingly not on long-term species sorting trajectories of the remaining bacterial community. Our results together suggest an unexpected niche division between yeast and bacterial communities and evidence ecological selection on the microbial communities in our system.
