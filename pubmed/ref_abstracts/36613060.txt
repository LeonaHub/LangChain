The purpose of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of the Children’s Eating Attitude Test (ChEAT) in a Chinese sample. A total of 906 children (mean age = 10.55, SD = 1.08) from three primary schools were evaluated by the ChEAT. Factor analysis was performed to examine the factor structure of the ChEAT. The children’s body mass index (BMI) was applied to assess the concurrent validity of the ChEAT. The ChEAT showed good internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.819) and split-half reliability (0.816) in Chinese children. Exploratory factor analysis suggested a four-factor structure, consistent with previous studies, which explained 41.16% of the total variance. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated good construct validity for the Chinese sample. The Chinese version of the ChEAT showed evidence for reliability and validity to evaluate the eating attitudes and behaviors for Chinese children. The mean score of each factor of the ChEAT differed significantly among different genders and BMI groups. Overweight girls had more eating disorder problems than normal-weight girls, and boys with lower BMI showed higher social eating pressure.
