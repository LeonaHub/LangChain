With the unexpected emergence of the novel 2019 Wuhan coronavirus, the world was faced with a sudden uproar that quickly shifted into a serious life-threatening pandemic. Affecting the lives of the global population and leaving drastic damage in various sections and systems, several measures have been constantly taken to tackle down this crisis. For instance, numerous vaccines have been developed in the past two years, some of which have been granted emergency use, thus providing sufficient immunity to the vaccinated individuals. However, the appearance of newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants with accelerated transmission and fatality has led the world towards another pandemic. Having undergone various mutations in genomic and/or amino acid profiles, some of the emerged variants of concern (VOCs) including Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta have displayed immune evasion and pathogenicity even in the vaccinated population, hence raising concerns regarding the efficacy of current vaccines against new VOCs of COVID-19. Therefore, genomic investigations of SARS-CoV-2 mutations are expected to provide valuable insight into the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, while also determining the impact of different mutations on infection severity. This study was constructed with the aim of shining light on recent advances regarding mutations in major COVID-19 VOCs, as well as vaccination efficacy against those VOCs.
