The combined text discusses the global decline in bumblebee populations, particularly in North America, due to factors like neonicotinoid pesticides. These pesticides are systemic and can persist in the environment, posing a threat to beneficial insects like bumblebees. A study focused on the effects of chronic exposure to the neonicotinoid clothianidin on bumblebees, specifically queen, worker, and male Bombus impatiens. The research found that clothianidin exposure had varying impacts on survival among the different sexes and castes of bumblebees, with workers showing better coping abilities compared to queens and males. The study also identified specific genes that were differentially expressed in response to clothianidin exposure, with workers exhibiting higher expression of detoxification genes compared to males. The research emphasizes the importance of considering queen and male survival assays in assessing the risk of neonicotinoids to wild bumblebee populations and highlights the significance of genomic approaches in studying the effects of pesticides on pollinator health.
