The text discusses the issue of medical student mistreatment and efforts to address it, particularly focusing on a film and curriculum developed by the University of Vermont Larner College of Medicine. The film aims to convey perspectives of learners and educators on mistreatment, encouraging behavior change and mutual empathy. The curriculum includes film and discussion sessions to promote cross-generational dialogue and create a positive learning environment. Evaluation data showed positive reception and impact on behavior change among students and educators. The text emphasizes the importance of addressing mistreatment through realistic depictions and promoting understanding among different groups. Further research is needed to assess the long-term impact of the curriculum and to address gaps in perspectives from patients and families in the clinical learning environment.
