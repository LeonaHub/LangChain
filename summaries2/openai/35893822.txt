The text discusses the global impact of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, leading to the COVID-19 pandemic with over 500 million confirmed cases. Efforts are being made to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, focusing on enhancing mucosal immunity to prevent viral replication and shedding in the airways. The text emphasizes the importance of mucosal immunity in defending against early SARS-CoV-2 infection by producing local mucosal secretory IgA responses. It also delves into the role of BAFF and APRIL cytokines in regulating B cell activity and antibody production, particularly in viral infections like COVID-19. Furthermore, the text explores the significance of chemokines like CXCL13, CCL19, and CCL21 in immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting their potential as predictive markers for disease severity. Additionally, the text discusses the formation of inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT) in enhancing immune responses and protecting against viral challenges, suggesting its importance in developing effective mucosal vaccines. Lastly, the text proposes the use of BAFF/APRIL or CXCL13 as vaccine adjuvants to enhance mucosal vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, potentially through an mRNA mucosal vaccine approach.
