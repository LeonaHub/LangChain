VKORC1 is a membrane protein crucial for vitamin K reduction and a target of the anticoagulant warfarin, with genetic variations affecting dosage requirements. VKORC1L1, a paralogous protein, may support carboxylation and potentially rescue VKORC1 activity in extrahepatic tissues during anticoagulation therapy. Experimental studies have explored the structure, function, and activity of VKORC1 and VKORC1L1, highlighting the importance of loop cysteines in VKORC1L1's intra-molecular electron transfer pathway for active site regeneration. The text discusses the membrane topology, enzymatic activity, and disulfide bond formation in VKORC1L1, emphasizing its distinct mechanisms compared to VKORC1. Further research is needed to fully understand the physiological functions of VKORC1 and VKORC1L1, particularly in vitamin K metabolism and carboxylation processes.
