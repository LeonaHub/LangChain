Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory condition affecting the skin and musculoskeletal system, with significant impacts on pain, function, and mental health. Patients with PsA often have comorbid conditions like obesity, sedentary lifestyles, and anxiety, leading to increased risks of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. Lifestyle modifications, nonpharmacologic interventions, and psychological support are crucial for managing PsA. Patients with PsA experience lower quality of life, psychological stress, and stigma, affecting their productivity and self-esteem. While health advice emphasizes exercise, diet, smoking cessation, and stress reduction to reduce CVD risks, evidence specific to PsA is limited. Treatment guidelines for PsA primarily focus on pharmacologic therapies, with only the ACR/NPF guidelines mentioning nonpharmacologic options like exercise, weight loss, and smoking cessation. A systematic review was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of nonpharmacologic interventions in improving quality of life for patients with Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA). The review aimed to address the knowledge gap in this area and contribute to the development of evidence-based interventions for this patient population. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO and followed the PRISMA guidelines. Various study types, including qualitative and quantitative methodologies, were included in the review to assess patient-reported outcomes related to quality of life. The review included non-randomized studies due to the lack of randomized trials and excluded certain types of publications. The participants considered were adults diagnosed with PsA by a rheumatologist or using specific criteria. The interventions evaluated were non-pharmacologic, psychological, and lifestyle modifications, while pharmacologic interventions were excluded. Outcome measures were based on patient-centered recommendations and the GRADE Working Group's suggestions. The text discusses the primary and secondary outcome measures used in a study evaluating disease activity in psoriatic arthritis. Primary outcomes included composite indexes such as AMDF-GRACE, CPDAI, and MDA, which assess skin status, musculoskeletal system status, physical function, and adverse events. Secondary outcomes included pain, radiographic changes, medication use, adverse event withdrawals, disability score, quality of life, depression, fatigue, cardiovascular disease incidence, and mortality. The study initially focused on primary outcomes but expanded to include secondary outcomes due to limited available studies. Data collection points for outcome measures were evaluated based on original study reports. A literature search was conducted in various
