Bladder cancer is a significant health concern in Europe, with a high incidence and mortality rate, particularly for patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). New therapeutic strategies, such as neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapies, are being explored to improve outcomes. Efforts are underway to develop predictive/prognostic models and identify molecular tissue biomarkers like survivin, CD68, CLEVER-1, MAC387, KRT5, KRT20, and ERBB2 to enhance risk assessment and treatment decisions in bladder cancer. The study aims to assess the prognostic role of these markers in MIBC patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy using immunohistochemistry (IHC) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) alongside clinical parameters. The research serves as a pilot study for validating biomarker assessment and forming hypotheses for future studies. The study findings may lead to prospective interventional study designs in the future. The text also discusses the significance of protein markers like survivin, GGH, emmprin, and DBI in predicting response to chemotherapy in bladder cancer patients. The presence of macrophages in tumor tissue has been linked to response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with different types of macrophages showing varying associations
