Tandem repeats (TRs) are repetitive DNA sequences found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, categorized into microsatellites and minisatellites. They are mutable and linked to diseases in humans and detrimental phenotypes in plants. TRs are highly variable among species, with no sequence conservation in centromere TRs. They are often located within genes and regulatory regions, affecting gene expression and nucleosome positioning. TR density varies among species and regions, with no correlation between genome size and TR density. TRs are abundant in plant promoters and introns, with specific motifs identified. GC content influences TR motif distribution, with GC-rich regions having GC-rich TR motifs. TRs are found in various regions of plant genomes, with differences in distribution trends among species. TRs play roles in gene expression regulation, splicing activities, and potential biological functions in transcription or translation. Despite limitations in data analysis, advancements in sequencing technologies are improving our understanding of TRs in plant and green alga genomes.
