A study conducted in Taiwan analyzed the correlation between air pollutants and spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) incidence in different age groups over a five-year period. The study integrated various datasets and used big data analysis methods to evaluate short-term effects of air pollution exposure. Results showed varying sICH incidence rates and air pollutant levels across regions, with ozone levels often exceeding normal limits. PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations were generally within limits, except in certain cities. The study found high correlations between pollutants like CO, NO2, PM10, and PM2.5, with significant influences on sICH incidence in middle-aged and elderly patients. NO2 was identified as a key factor, particularly in patients over 80 years old. The study suggested potential adjustments to pollution control policies due to high pollutant levels and their impact on sICH risk. Further research is recommended to better understand these correlations and potentially incorporate additional factors for analysis.
