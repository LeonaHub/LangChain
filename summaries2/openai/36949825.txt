Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a trauma-stressor-related disorder characterized by symptoms such as intrusive recollections, hyperarousal, avoidant behavior, and cognitive and emotional changes. The DSM-5 and ICD-11 provide criteria for diagnosing PTSD, with exposure to extremely traumatic events being a key factor. PTSD can lead to significant distress and functional impairment, with various factors such as gender, mental illness, and poor social support being associated with its development. Studies show varying prevalence rates of PTSD globally, with estimates ranging from 3.6% to 88% among internally displaced populations. In Ethiopia, PTSD is prevalent due to conflicts, accidents, and displacement, with rates ranging from 15.4% to 85%. A meta-analysis and systematic review study in Ethiopia found a pooled prevalence of 39.28% among adults, with factors like poor social support and being female associated with an increased likelihood of developing PTSD. The study also highlighted the impact of witnessing traumatic events and previous mental illness on PTSD development. The importance of social support in preventing PTSD and the need for immediate intervention for those exposed to trauma, especially individuals with a history of mental illness, were emphasized.
