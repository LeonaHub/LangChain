Renal cell carcinoma is a deadly urological tumor with unknown specific causes, but factors like smoking, hypertension, and genetics may increase the risk. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MAGE-A11 gene have been studied for their role in cancer development, particularly in prostate cancer. A study aimed to investigate the role of two common SNPs in the MAGE-A11 gene in renal cell carcinoma risk and survival through case-control and cohort studies. The study analyzed over 1000 cases and controls, genotyped specific SNPs, and found associations between certain SNPs and RCC risk, with the C allele of rs6641352 associated with a higher risk of tumorigenesis. The study also identified associations between hypertension, diabetes, and RCC development. Specific genetic variations were found to impact RCC risk and survival, with rs6641352 associated with a poorer prognosis. The study highlighted the importance of genetic variations in influencing RCC risk and patient outcomes, particularly in the Chinese population. Further research is needed to understand the exact mechanisms and validate the findings.
