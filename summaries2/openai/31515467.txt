A study conducted at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University focused on investigating the role of circ_0079993, a circular RNA derived from the POLR2J4 gene, in colorectal cancer (CRC). The study involved analyzing gene expression in CRC cell lines, conducting various experiments to assess the effects of treatments on CRC cells, and identifying interactions between circ_0079993, miR-203a-3p.1, and CREB1 in CRC progression. The results indicated that circ_0079993 was highly expressed in CRC tissues and associated with poor prognosis, while knockdown of circ_0079993 inhibited CRC cell growth. The study highlighted the potential of circRNAs as diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers in CRC and suggested that the circ_0079993-miR-203a-3p.1-CREB1 axis plays a crucial role in CRC progression. Further research is needed to explore additional functional mechanisms of circ_0079993 in CRC and to understand the complex regulatory networks involving circular RNAs in CRC pathogenesis.
