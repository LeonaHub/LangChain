The text discusses the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (SNPs) using biological methods, particularly focusing on the biosynthesis of SNPs by Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. It highlights the involvement of various cellular proteins in controlling the size, shape, and distribution of biosynthesized SNPs. The study identifies specific proteins, such as histone (H4), ATPase, carbonic anhydrase, and superoxide dismutase, associated with SNPs biosynthesis. The research emphasizes the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms and redox reactions involved in the biosynthesis and capping of SNPs. Various experimental techniques, including transmission electron microscopy (TEM), SDS-PAGE, and MALDI-MS analysis, were used to characterize the biosynthesized nanoparticles and identify the proteins associated with them. The text also discusses the differences in size and distribution of in vitro and in vivo biosynthesized SNPs, with in vivo SNPs found to be larger. The study highlights the potential of using eukaryotic organisms like C. reinhardtii for the eco-friendly synthesis of SNPs and underscores the significance of controlling the size and shape of nanoparticles for commercial production.
