Breast cancer incidence rates vary globally, with higher rates in Western countries and lower rates in Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia. Breast cancer can be classified into different subtypes based on hormone receptor status and other biomarkers, which influence treatment and prognosis. Studies show that African women often have aggressive subtypes like triple-negative breast cancer. In the U.S., there are differences in breast cancer rates and outcomes among racial/ethnic groups. In Europe, studies on breast cancer among immigrant populations are limited, but some suggest differences in subtype distribution compared to native Europeans. Socioeconomic status plays a role in disparities in breast cancer outcomes in the U.S. This text discusses a study conducted in Norway on breast cancer occurrence in women aged 20-75 years, analyzing breast cancer subtypes among immigrant groups categorized by their country of birth. The research uses cohort data from national Norwegian population registries linked with the Cancer Registry of Norway to analyze breast cancer diagnoses among different immigrant groups. The study found differences in subtype distribution among immigrant subgroups, with variations in rates of different breast cancer subtypes based on region of birth and age. Immigrant women from high-income countries in Norway had similar breast cancer incidence rates as non-immigrant women, with luminal A-like breast cancer being the most common subtype across all groups. The study also found that immigrant women from Eastern Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia had different rates of certain subtypes compared to non-immigrant women, with variations in tumor grades and estrogen receptor-positive tumors. The study suggests that differences in tumor characteristics among immigrant groups may be influenced by genetics, lifestyle, and healthcare seeking practices, emphasizing the importance of tailoring preventive and screening strategies based on specific immigrant group characteristics.
