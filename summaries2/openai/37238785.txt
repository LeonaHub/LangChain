The Maillard reaction is a non-enzymatic process that occurs at high temperatures, leading to the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) like CML and CEL, which are associated with diseases such as atherosclerosis and diabetes. Acrylamide, another compound formed during this reaction, is considered a probable carcinogen. Regulatory measures aim to reduce acrylamide content in foods. Plant-based meat analogs (PBMA) are gaining popularity as an alternative to traditional meat products, but their production can also lead to the formation of harmful compounds like AGEs and acrylamide. Studies have analyzed the contents of these compounds in PBMA and suggest optimizing production processes to reduce their levels. The amino acid profile, fatty acid content, and sugar composition of PBMA influence the formation of harmful compounds during cooking. Recommendations include using plant proteins with high methionine and cysteine content to meet human amino acid requirements and reducing unsaturated fatty acids to inhibit acrylamide formation. Future research will focus on reducing harmful compounds in PBMA.
