The text extensively discusses the folding and stability of apomyoglobin (apoMb) in comparison to holomyoglobin (holoMb). It delves into the structural dynamics of apoMb, particularly focusing on an equilibrium intermediate (I) formed during acid-induced unfolding. The study examines the impact of various substitutions, such as overpacking, underpacking, and polar substitutions, at position 131 on the stability of different protein forms. The methods used for mutagenesis, protein expression, and purification are outlined. The text details the analysis of urea-induced unfolding transitions of apoMb variants, emphasizing the effects of different amino acid substitutions on stability. It also explores the correlation between chemical features, such as side-chain packing and hydrophobicity, and the stability of apoMb. The study highlights the importance of understanding tertiary interactions and stability in protein structures, particularly in relation to side-chain packing and hydrophobicity. The text suggests that specific native-like packing interactions and hydrophobicity play significant roles in stabilizing apoMb. Additionally, it discusses the surprising stability of the apoMb N form due to hydrophobic overpacking substitutions and the potential structural plasticity in the region of Met-131. The study contrasts earlier interpretations regarding residue interactions and emphasizes the need for further research to differentiate between packing and hydrophobicity effects in protein regions.
