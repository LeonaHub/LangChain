Biodegradable polymers like poly-Îµ-caprolactone (PCL) are widely used in tissue engineering due to their versatility and biocompatibility. However, the variability in their chemical structure can affect their properties and in vivo performance. PCL is commonly used in tissue engineering applications such as vascular grafting, with electrospinning being a popular method for fabricating vascular scaffolds. The prolonged presence of un-resorbed scaffolds can lead to complications like mineralization and fibrosis. Studies have focused on understanding graft mineralization in polymeric scaffolds like PCL for organ engineering development. Research has involved analyzing electrospun PCL grafts in animal models over a 180-day period to assess their advantages, disadvantages, and distant effects. The studies have included detailed observations on the structural integrity and performance of the implanted scaffolds, highlighting outcomes such as graft encapsulation, neointimal hyperplasia, and scaffold degradation with remodeling and vitalization. The importance of prompt biodegradation of the scaffold for cellularization and revitalization is emphasized, along with the need for further research to understand the mechanisms of these processes.
