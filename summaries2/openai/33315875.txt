Helminths, particularly Schistosoma worms, infect over a billion people globally, with Schistosomiasis being prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa. The interaction between the parasite and host is crucial for the parasite's survival, involving manipulation of the host's metabolism and immune responses. Schistosomes rely on host glucose for energy and can modulate the host's immune system to promote their survival. A study in Zimbabwe investigated the impact of S. haematobium infection on the metabolic phenotype of preschool-aged children, finding significant alterations in metabolite profiles related to energy and purine metabolism. The study used mass spectrometry to detect and quantify metabolites, revealing changes in metabolite concentrations with infection intensity that were restored after treatment. The parasite's energy demands affect host metabolism, leading to changes in glycolysis, glycogenolysis, and fatty acid synthesis. The study suggests that metabolic alterations are linked to disease progression in schistosome infection, with potential for interventions like nutraceuticals to address helminth infections in children. Further research is needed to understand the clinical implications of these metabolic changes and their impact on schistosome-related health issues in children.
