Rabies is a deadly viral infection primarily affecting mammals, with dogs being a significant source of human cases, especially in Africa. The World Health Organization aims to eliminate rabies deaths by 2030, but challenges exist due to limited access to treatment in rural areas and inadequate dog vaccination. A study in Ghana analyzed data on rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) at a hospital, revealing that most cases were in children aged 1-10, with dog bites being the most common. Males were more likely to delay seeking PEP, often due to distance from treatment facilities. The study emphasizes the importance of immediate PEP initiation to prevent rabies and calls for public health actions to reduce rabies-related deaths in Ghana. Limitations of the study include reliance on self-reported data and lack of tracking rabies incidence post-prophylaxis. Improved patient counseling, public education on avoiding animal bites, and enforcing animal vaccination are recommended to address rabies as a public health concern in Ghana.
