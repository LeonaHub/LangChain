Platelets play a crucial role in hemostasis and development, with CLEC-2 being a key activatory receptor that interacts with podoplanin. Studies using knockout mouse models and anti-CLEC-2 antibodies have shown the importance of CLEC-2 in separating blood and lymphatic systems and its role in thrombus stability. A new study using CLEC-2 Y7A knockin mice investigated CLEC-2 functions through various experiments. The Y7A mutation in CLEC-2 abolished platelet responses to specific agonists and led to lymphatic defects. Despite maintaining CLEC-2 surface expression, Y7A KI platelets showed a loss of aggregation responses to rhodocytin. The study also found that blocking CLEC-2 destabilizes hemostasis and thrombosis, affecting vessel occlusion and bleeding times. The research suggests that CLEC-2 contributes to thrombus stability independently of hemITAM signaling. Further studies are needed to identify the specific ligand or counterreceptor of CLEC-2 in thrombosis and hemostasis.
