The text discusses the significance of sucrose as a carbohydrate transport form in maize and how source-to-sink resource allocation influences grain filling and maize yield enhancement. It emphasizes the role of acid invertase in regulating plant primary carbon metabolism, particularly during early kernel development, and its response to environmental stimuli like drought and salinity. The study identifies a maize invertase inhibitor, Zm-INVINH4, which inhibits invertase activity in both cell wall and vacuolar enzymes, especially under drought stress. The research aims to understand how Zm-INVINH4 modulates invertase-related growth in maize to improve productivity and prevent seed abortion. The study involved conducting drought treatments and ABA applications on maize plants to monitor gene expression and invertase activity. Various molecular biology techniques were used to clone and express Zm-INVINH4, including creating XFP fusions for protein expression and conducting inhibition assays. The experiments were statistically analyzed using SPSS software.
