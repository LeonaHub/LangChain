The text discusses the increasing prevalence of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in the United States and the correlation between this rise and factors such as improving economics, obesity, longer life expectancy, and higher rates of joint implants in younger patients. It highlights the risks associated with TKA, particularly vascular complications like venous thromboembolism (VTE) and chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), which can impact surgical outcomes and increase healthcare costs. Several studies analyzed the outcomes of TKA in patients with CVI, finding that CVI was associated with increased hospital stays, healthcare costs, readmissions, infections, and other complications. The severity of CVI was classified, with complex CVI patients at higher risk for complications compared to those with simple CVI. However, overall, CVI did not significantly affect postoperative complications, revisions, or readmissions compared to patients without CVI. The studies emphasize the importance of understanding and stratifying CVI severity to accurately assess patient risk and anticipate potential postoperative complications in the growing number of TKA procedures in the US. Further research is needed to better understand the effects of CVI on TKA outcomes and improve patient care.
