Eosinophils are key players in inflammatory diseases like bronchial asthma, with therapies targeting eosinophils proving beneficial for severe eosinophilic asthma patients. Eosinophils differentiate from CD34+ progenitor cells in the bone marrow under the influence of cytokines like IL-5 and play roles in inflammation, tissue damage, and immune responses. The IL-5/IL-5Rα axis is crucial for eosinophil proliferation and maturation, with monoclonal antibodies like mepolizumab and benralizumab targeting this axis for treatment. Benralizumab, in particular, inhibits IL-5 binding and induces eosinophil depletion through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, impacting eosinophils at various stages of their life cycle. The text also discusses the potential roles of eosinophils in immunity against parasites, viruses, and tumors, highlighting conflicting evidence on their involvement in tumor clearance and immune responses. Additionally, the text touches on the impact of eosinophil depletion on autoimmune responses in asthma patients and the safety profile of benralizumab. Overall, eosinophils and the IL-5/IL-5α axis are emphasized as significant factors in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, particularly eosinophilic asthma, with benralizumab offering a unique treatment approach. Further research is needed to fully understand the diverse functions and implications of eosinophils in health and disease.
