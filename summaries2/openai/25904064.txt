Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI IMS) is a technology that combines mass spectrometry with histology to visualize biomolecules in tissue. This technique involves coating tissue sections with a MALDI matrix, using a laser to generate mass spectra, and creating ion images that provide a molecular dimension to traditional histological analysis. MALDI IMS has been used to analyze various analyte classes, including pharmaceuticals, metabolites, lipids, peptides, and proteins. Protein imaging experiments are particularly interesting as they can describe different molecular forms of proteins, such as genetic variations and post-translational modifications. Protein identification strategies include bottom-up, top-down, and indirect methods. Bottom-up proteomics involves enzymatic digestion of proteins before mass spectrometry analysis, preserving spatial integrity during imaging experiments. Top-down proteomics involves intact protein analysis followed by MS/MS, allowing for spatial description of proteoforms but facing challenges with fragmentation efficiency. Indirect identification combines information from separate IMS and proteomics experiments. Further development is needed to improve image quality and sensitivity in these approaches. MALDI FTICR IMS technology provides high mass accuracy and resolving power, enabling confident protein identifications in tissue samples. The study focuses on the protein S100A8, a subunit of calprotectin, and its modifications in response to Staphylococcus aureus infection. The text also details methodologies for preparing tissue samples, analyzing proteins using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and sequencing peptides. MALDI FTICR IMS allows for accurate identification of proteins and their modifications, providing rich data with good sensitivity. The study aims to understand the impact of oxidative damage on S100A8 during host-pathogen interactions, highlighting the importance of IMS in studying protein modifications and their biological significance in infection biology and inflammation.
