Heavy drinking among college students is a prevalent issue leading to negative consequences like emergency medical care, disciplinary actions, health problems, and risky behaviors. Efforts to address this issue include interventions like mandatory alcohol education programs. Research has shown that skills-based and motivational interventions are more successful in reducing alcohol use and consequences. Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) and Student Assistance Programs aim to address substance abuse and personal issues among employees and college students, respectively. Studies have shown the effectiveness of these programs in reducing alcohol and drug use. The University Assistance Program (UAP) offers tailored assessments and interventions for students with alcohol or mental health problems, showing reductions in alcohol consumption and related consequences. However, more research is needed to determine the effectiveness of these interventions in reducing heavy drinking episodes and overall alcohol consumption. Studies have also highlighted the importance of addressing coping skills in interventions with mandated students and the need for further research to determine the appropriate level and intensity of services needed for effective intervention.
