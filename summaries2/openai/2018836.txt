The text discusses the role of fibrinopeptide B release and the exposure of the NH2-terminus of the β-chain in fibrin clot formation by thrombin. It presents a study on a patient with hypofibrinogenemia and their family members, showing discrepancies in fibrinogen concentration measurements. The study includes methods for coagulation studies, purification of fibrinogen, and analysis of fibrinopeptides. It describes a new β-chain variant in congenitally abnormal fibrinogen Ise, characterized by delayed fibrinopeptide B release and a single amino acid substitution. The text also explores the impact of mutations on fibrinogen structure and function, such as the substitution of Bβ glycine-15 by cysteine. Additionally, it discusses the unique characteristics of fibrinogen Detroit and fibrinogen Ise, two variants with abnormal polymerization and clot formation. High concentrations of thrombin are recommended for analyzing abnormal fibrinogens with defective release of fibrinopeptides.
