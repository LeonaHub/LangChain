The text discusses the role of fibrinopeptide B release and the exposure of the NH2-terminus of the β-chain in fibrin clot formation by thrombin. It mentions congenitally abnormal fibrinogens with molecular defects, such as fibrinogens New York I, Christchurch II, Seattle I, and Pontoise. A new β-chain variant in fibrinogen Ise is described, characterized by a slow release rate of fibrinopeptide B and a cysteine substitution for glycine at Bβ 15. The text details coagulation studies, purification of fibrinogen, and HPLC analysis of protein samples. Case studies of individuals with hypofibrinogenemia and discrepancies in fibrinogen concentration measurements are presented. The study found abnormalities in fibrinogen processing and clot formation in the propositus, including delayed Bβ-chain conversion and weaker fibrin clots. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed specific substitutions in abnormal peaks of fibrinogen Ise. The text also discusses the impact of Bβ-chains on fibrin clot formation and the importance of fibrinopeptide B release. Additionally, it explores the effects of mutations on fibrinogen structure and function, recommending the use of high thrombin concentrations for analyzing abnormal fibrinogens.
