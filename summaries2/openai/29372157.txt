Endometriosis is a common condition in women, with ovarian endometriosis being a frequent manifestation. Surgical treatment is often used, but recurrence of endometriomas is common. Repeated surgeries can lead to decreased ovarian reserve and fertility issues. Dienogest is a medication that has shown promise in preventing recurrence of endometriomas with minimal side effects. Studies have found that long-term use of dienogest can be effective in reducing pain and preventing recurrence of ovarian endometrioma. It is suggested that dienogest could be used therapeutically for an extended period until the patient decides to become pregnant. Additional research is needed to determine the maximum age for long-term dienogest therapy.
