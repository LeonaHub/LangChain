The male reproductive tract consists of various components such as the testis, excurrent ductules, and accessory glands like the prostate and seminal vesicle. The epididymis, a part of the excurrent ductules, is crucial for sperm maturation and storage. It regulates the microenvironment for sperm maturation through water movement, facilitated by aquaporins (AQPs) found in different cell types within the epididymis. The expression of AQPs in the male reproductive tract is influenced by hormones like androgen and estrogen, and changes in their expression can impact male fertility. Nandrolone decanoate (ND), an androgenic-anabolic steroidal compound, is used for medical purposes but can negatively affect male fertility by altering steroidogenic enzymes in the testis and decreasing epididymal weight. A study investigated the impact of ND treatment on the expression of Aqp1 and Aqp9 in different segments of the rat epididymis over 2-week and 12-week periods. Results showed varying effects of low and high doses of ND on Aqp1 and Aqp9 expression in different parts of the epididymis. The research suggests a segment-specific, dose-dependent, and treatment duration-dependent regulation of Aqp1 and Aqp9 expression by ND, potentially leading to infertility due to abnormal expression of these aquaporins. Further research is needed to understand the detailed molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of Aqp1 and Aqp9 expression in the epididymis by ND.
