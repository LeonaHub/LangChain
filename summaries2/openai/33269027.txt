Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific syndrome characterized by endothelial malfunction and vasospasm, typically manifesting after 20 weeks of gestation. It is defined by symptoms such as increased blood pressure, fluid retention, and proteinuria, with risk factors including nulliparity, obesity, diabetes, and advanced maternal age. Early diagnosis is challenging due to nonspecific symptoms, and delayed detection can lead to severe consequences for both the mother and infant. The pathophysiology involves disrupted blood flow to the placenta, resulting in hypoxia and cellular death, with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) playing a key role. A study evaluated serum LDH levels in preeclampsia, finding significant differences between control and preeclampsia groups, as well as between mild and severe cases. LDH levels correlated with blood pressure and were used to create a ROC curve. LDH isoenzyme distribution was analyzed, showing changes in preeclampsia cases compared to normal pregnancy. Elevated LDH levels were associated with disease severity and outcomes in preeclampsia patients, suggesting LDH as a potential biochemical marker for assessing and managing the condition. LDH isoenzyme patterns can provide insights into energy metabolism and oxygen availability, with changes indicating impending preeclampsia. Further validation through larger studies is needed to confirm these findings.
