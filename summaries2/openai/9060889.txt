The text discusses the use of intravenous dipyridamole during exercise testing to improve diagnostic accuracy in patients with inadequate physical performance for conventional stress tests. A study involving myocardial single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with dipyridamole administration during exercise found improved sensitivity and negative predictive value in patients with inadequate exercise tests or on beta-blocker therapy. The protocol aims to enhance the diagnostic yield of SPECT without losing prognostic data, particularly in patients unable to achieve peak heart rate and oxygen consumption during perfusion scintigraphy. The study also compared patients undergoing dipyridamole stress testing for coronary artery disease, noting differences in disease prevalence and gender distribution between groups. Additionally, the text highlights the benefits of combining dipyridamole with exercise to achieve maximal vasodilation and improve cardiac image quality, especially for patients unable to perform dynamic exercise.
