Neutrophils are essential immune cells that help fight infections, and their timely removal through apoptosis is crucial for resolving inflammation. Factors like uremic plasma and dialyzer membranes can accelerate neutrophil apoptosis in patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing hemodialysis. A study in Egypt evaluated neutrophil apoptosis in these patients and explored the potential benefits of GM-CSF in preventing severe bacterial infections. The study involved isolating and culturing neutrophils from patients and healthy controls, assessing apoptosis activity, CD18 expression, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) levels. Results showed increased apoptosis, decreased viability, and elevated inflammatory markers in patients compared to controls. GM-CSF was found to inhibit neutrophil apoptosis and increase viability in both patient groups. The study suggests that uremia and inflammation can impact neutrophil function, leading to dysfunctional apoptosis and increased infection risk in CKD and HD patients. Dialysis may help normalize apoptosis rates by clearing toxic solutes, but it can also impair neutrophil function. GM-CSF showed promise in improving neutrophil survival, potentially offering a new approach to managing infections in these high-risk populations. Further research is needed to validate these findings in clinical settings.
