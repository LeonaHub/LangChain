Primary Sj√∂gren's Syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune disease that primarily affects exocrine glands, leading to symptoms like dry eyes and dry mouth. It predominantly affects females and can also involve extra-glandular symptoms such as pain, fatigue, and an increased risk of lymphoma, impacting patients' quality of life and healthcare costs. Non-pharmacological interventions for pSS may target various symptoms and involve multidisciplinary teams, with limited evidence supporting their efficacy. Studies have focused on interventions like punctal plugs, intraoral lubricating devices, acupuncture, and psychodynamic group therapy to alleviate symptoms in pSS patients. However, the studies reviewed had limitations such as lack of blinding, incomplete outcome data, and small sample sizes, making it challenging to determine the true effectiveness of these interventions. More well-designed randomized controlled trials with patient-centered outcomes are needed to support non-pharmacological interventions for pSS and improve the quality of life for affected individuals.
