Clostridium difficile is a bacterium causing antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis, with changing epidemiology showing increased community-associated cases. Asymptomatic carriers, like hospitalized patients and infants, can transmit the bacterium. A study on preterm neonates aimed to determine C. difficile colonization frequency, strain characteristics, and perinatal determinants. Methods included fecal sample collection, strain analysis, and toxin detection. Results showed colonization increasing during hospitalization, peaking post-discharge, and decreasing after 12 months. Genetic analysis revealed diverse strains, with some being toxigenic. Factors like gestational age and birth weight influenced colonization. The study found a high colonization rate in preterm neonates, with a shift from non-toxigenic to toxigenic strains post-discharge, possibly acquired from the community. Limitations included being monocentric and using older specimens. The study provides insights into C. difficile colonization patterns in preterm neonates, suggesting they may act as a transient reservoir for pathogenic strains.
