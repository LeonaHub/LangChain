Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a radiation-free imaging technique that measures the magnetic moments of magnetic nanoparticles using an alternating magnetic field, offering high temporal and spatial resolution. While MPI shows promise for imaging the cardiovascular system and local perfusion, combining it with other modalities like MRI or CT is necessary for anatomical information. Current MPI tracers have limitations, leading to the development of new tracers with improved properties. Two main methods for synthesizing magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) are coprecipitation and thermal decomposition, each with strengths and weaknesses. The ideal MPI tracer should have specific characteristics such as a magnetic core diameter of approximately 25 nm, monodispersity, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. The text discusses the synthesis and evaluation of multicore particles (MCP) as a new generation of MPI tracers with promising properties. Various measurements and analyses are used to characterize the magnetic nanoparticles, including dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, and magnetic particle spectroscopy. The text also describes the process of creating and studying phantoms for MPI, as well as the reconstruction of MRI data obtained from phantom measurements. The study evaluates the sensitivity, selectivity, and spatial resolution achieved using MCP as a tracer in MPI imaging, highlighting the importance of optimizing reconstruction parameters. MCP
