The text emphasizes the importance of the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) in evaluating the market competitiveness of different energy sources, particularly focusing on emerging technologies like halide perovskites for solar cells. It discusses the challenges in accurately determining the LCOE for perovskite PV systems, considering factors such as efficiency, stability, manufacturing costs, and system degradation. The text highlights the need for refining assumptions and developing common methods to account for uncertainties in LCOE calculations. It also addresses the challenges in scaling up perovskite PV technology from laboratory to commercial production, emphasizing the importance of increasing power conversion efficiency and stability to compete in the market. Strategies to reduce LCOE for perovskite photovoltaics include exploring alternative materials, increasing production capacity, and improving performance and stability. The text anticipates the emergence of a standard production line for perovskite PVs during the early industrialization stage.
