A new antibody sandwich ELISA method was developed to detect the major capsid protein (MCP) antigen concentration in inactivated Infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV) vaccines. ISKNV infections in fish species have been a concern, prompting the study to focus on vaccination as a preventive measure due to the lack of effective antiviral treatments. The research involved generating mouse monoclonal antibodies against ISKNV, optimizing coating and capture antibodies, and developing an ELISA assay to measure antigen concentrations in the vaccine. The study utilized various techniques such as virus proliferation, monoclonal antibody production, and ELISA to measure viral titer and antigen quality. The double-antibody sandwich ELISA method was found to be sensitive, convenient, and accurate for detecting antigen concentrations in inactivated ISKNV vaccines, providing a useful tool for assessing vaccine quality. The study demonstrated a positive correlation between antigen concentration and viral titers, indicating the reliability of the ELISA method in determining antigen quality in inactivated vaccines.
