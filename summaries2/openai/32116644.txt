The text discusses the role of electrophile signaling in the central nervous system (CNS), focusing on endogenous reactive electrophilic metabolites and exogenous electrophilic agents. It highlights the production of lipid-derived electrophiles (LDEs) in neuronal membranes and their implications in neurodegenerative diseases due to low levels of detoxifying enzymes in the CNS. The text explores methods like activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) and T-REX for studying LDEs and their protein targets, emphasizing the identification of kinetically privileged sensors. It delves into the role of LDE signaling in regulating Keap1/Nrf2/Antioxidant Response (AR) signaling in diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS), discussing the therapeutic effects of Dimethyl Fumarate (DMF) and its mechanisms of action. The text also touches on the potential involvement of proteins like PKCθ and GAPDH in DMF-induced immune modulation. Additionally, it discusses the impact of DMF on NFκB
