Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a significant global health concern, with prevention strategies traditionally focusing on short-term risk assessment and pharmacological treatments. Recent guidelines suggest considering lifetime risk (LTR) for a more comprehensive assessment, especially for individuals with elevated risk factors like young people and women. A study conducted in Tehran, Iran, aimed to estimate the LTR for total CVD in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, which has a high prevalence of CVD-related deaths. The research involved a population-based prospective cohort of over 10,000 participants aged 20 years and older, focusing on various risk factors such as body mass index (BMI), hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and hypercholesterolemia. The study found that women generally had a lower lifetime risk of CVD compared to men, with the presence of individual risk factors increasing the LTR for CVD at ages 20 and 40. The impact of aggregate risk factors on survival free of CVD was more pronounced in men compared to women. Maintaining optimal risk factors from a young age was associated with a lower long-term risk of CVD death. Overall, the findings emphasize the importance of preventing major risk factors to prolong CVD-free survival, improve quality of life, and reduce healthcare costs.
