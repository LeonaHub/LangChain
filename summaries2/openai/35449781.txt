Orthodontic patients often experience anxiety and pain during treatment, impacting compliance. Pain is caused by biological changes in the periodontal ligament and may be exacerbated by pulpal inflammation, peaking around 24 hours after force application. Pain relief options include NSAIDs and nonpharmacological methods like chewing gum and low-level laser therapy. A study compared the effectiveness of chewing gum and tenoxicam for pain relief after initial archwire placement, finding no significant overall difference in pain control. Chewing gum was as effective as tenoxicam, suggesting it as a non-pharmacological alternative for orthodontic pain management. The study used a visual analog scale to assess pain perception during various dental functions at different time points. Results showed peak pain at different times for each group, with no significant demographic differences. The study highlights the importance of evidence-based research for establishing pain management protocols in orthodontic treatment.
