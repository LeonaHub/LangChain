The text discusses the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, leading to the COVID-19 pandemic with significant global impacts. Various types of vaccines have been developed based on the Spike glycoprotein of the virus, with concerns arising due to the emergence of variants like Omicron. The development and testing of a new vaccine candidate combining the S protein with an autophagy-inducing peptide called AIP-C5 have shown enhanced T cell immune responses and protection against SARS-CoV-2 in animal models. Studies have evaluated the immune responses and protective efficacy of these vaccines in mice and golden Syrian hamsters, highlighting the importance of mucosal immunization and the role of T cell responses in vaccine efficacy. The text also emphasizes the need for new vaccines offering cross-protection against variants and long-lasting efficacy. Additionally, it discusses the importance of cellular-mediated immune responses and the correlation between neutralizing antibodies and protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study focuses on investigating the durability and effectiveness of specific vaccine candidates in inducing memory immune responses and reducing virus excretion. Methods used for evaluating immune responses in animal models, including ELISA, ELISpot assays, and virus neutralization assays, are described. Challenge experiments in hamsters involved monitoring weight changes, clinical signs, and sample collection for virus load quantification and histopathological analysis.
