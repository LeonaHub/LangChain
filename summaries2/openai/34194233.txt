Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a significant global public health concern due to its impact on morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. The inadequate or excessive use of antibiotics accelerates the evolution of bacteria, leading to AMR. Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a growing challenge worldwide, with the emergence of "the ESKAPE pathogens" - a group of six bacteria that can evade the effects of antibiotics. The development of new antibiotics is not keeping pace with the rate of MDR progression, emphasizing the urgent need for further research and action in combating AMR. Rational antibiotic use is crucial to preserve their effectiveness, in line with global initiatives such as the Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance by the WHO and the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance trends, with a study in Romania evaluating bacterial isolates from hospitalized patients from 2016 to 2020. The study focused on ESKAPE germs, showing a decrease in isolated bacterial strains over the years, with a significant drop in 2020 due to the pandemic. Various bacterial strains exhibited specific antimicrobial resistance patterns, with some showing increased resistance while others decreased. The study highlights challenges in microbiological diagnosis and changes in antibiotic sensitivity testing standards affecting data analysis, emphasizing the need for improved surveillance and diagnostic methods to address AMR issues. The text also discusses the high rates of AMR in invasive infections in Romania and the challenges faced by the healthcare system in dealing with antibiotic resistance, stressing the importance of updating local antibiotic prescription protocols and aligning with European standards to improve AMR control practices.
