Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is a crucial intervention for heart failure patients, but challenges exist in patient selection and response rates. A study explores the use of three-dimensional electrical body surface mapping to understand electrical activation in CRT better. The research focuses on parameters like time to 80% of right ventricle (RV) and left ventricle (LV) activation, offering more accurate predictions for therapy response than traditional measures like QRS duration. The study aims to address variability in RV and LV activation rates during the QRS duration, impacting CRT outcomes. It involves a prospective cohort study of 30 adult patients with chronic systolic heart failure and an indication for CRT, using echocardiography, cardiac MRI, and CardioInsight Mapping for electrical mapping. The study evaluates novel LV80 and RV80 assessments before and after CRT to predict response measures like LV function and exercise capacity. Results show differences in baseline characteristics and response measures between patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) and right bundle branch block (RBBB), with implications for biventricular activation. The study also examines the impact of pacing strategies on LV and RV activation rates and the association between electrical parameters and CRT response measures. It highlights the importance of interventricular electrical synchrony in predicting improvements in left ventricular function with pacing and the significance of RV-specific or LV-specific activation in predicting CRT response outcomes. The study suggests that RV electrical activation parameters can predict changes in peak VO2 after CRT and emphasizes the potential clinical implications of understanding RV function and electrical activation in CRT response. The text discusses the potential future applications of three-dimensional electrical mapping in guiding CRT pacing strategies and improving outcomes,
