Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy with a complex multistep carcinogenesis process involving factors such as chronic hepatitis B and C viruses, smoking, and alcohol abuse. Genomic instability and gene alterations play a crucial role in the early stages of HCC development. The X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) gene, involved in DNA repair, has three common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have been studied in relation to cancer risk. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to estimate the risk of HCC associated with XRCC1 polymorphisms. The study analyzed data from 11 studies involving 2075 HCC patients and 2604 control subjects, focusing on three XRCC1 gene polymorphisms: Arg194Trp, Arg280His, and Arg399Gln. The results showed mixed associations for the Arg194Trp and Arg280His polymorphisms in different populations, while the Arg399Gln polymorphism did not show a significant association with HCC risk. Further research is recommended to clarify the role of XRCC1 gene polymorphisms in HCC susceptibility, considering factors like exposure to carcinogens and types of DNA damage.
