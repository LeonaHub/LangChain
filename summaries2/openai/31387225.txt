The text discusses the extraction of bioactive compounds, specifically fucose and total glucans, from brown macroalgae using hydrothermal-assisted extraction (HAE) and other innovative technologies. These compounds have shown diverse biological activities, making them attractive for biomedical applications. The study focuses on optimizing extraction conditions, such as temperature, time, and solvent volume, to maximize yields of fucose, total glucans, and antioxidant activities. Different extraction methods, including ultrasound and thermal treatments, are explored to enhance the efficiency of extracting high-value compounds from macroalgae. The chemical structure of macroalgal polysaccharides influences their biological activities, and factors like species, extraction procedures, and location impact the extraction efficiency. The study uses statistical optimization tools like response surface methodology to predict optimal extraction conditions and assess the impact of extraction process parameters on yields. Further research is needed to fully purify and characterize the extracted fractions for potential industrial applications.
