A study focused on patients with dominantly inherited retinitis pigmentosa and mutations in the rhodopsin gene, with over 100 identified mutations. The research aimed to analyze disease severity based on mutation type and location within the rhodopsin molecule. Longitudinal follow-up examinations were conducted on 140 patients over 2 to 25 years, assessing visual acuity, visual field, and electroretinographic data. The study found variations in disease progression based on the specific mutation region, with patients having mutations in the C-terminus showing faster disease progression. The research highlighted the importance of longitudinal studies in accurately measuring disease course and emphasized the impact of specific regions of the rhodopsin molecule on disease progression. The study also discussed the influence of factors beyond gene defects on disease progression and the limitations in predicting progression rates solely based on rhodopsin mutations.
