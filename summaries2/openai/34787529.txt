Bacterial meningitis is a serious condition in neonates with high mortality rates and long-term complications. Diagnosing neonatal bacterial meningitis can be challenging due to high false-negative rates in cerebrospinal fluid cultures and non-specific symptoms. Early diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. A study analyzed clinical data, laboratory results, and CNS imaging of neonates with NBM to determine differences between patients with positive and negative CSF culture results and identify factors influencing positive culture outcomes. The study found that Escherichia coli, Group B streptococcus, and Staphylococcus were common pathogens in NBM. Patients with positive CSF cultures were more likely to have severe symptoms and neurological damage, emphasizing the importance of early detection and aggressive treatment to reduce complications. High CSF protein levels were associated with positive cultures and poorer outcomes, suggesting the need for more aggressive treatment strategies in these cases.
