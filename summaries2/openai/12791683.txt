The text discusses the crucial interaction between the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and promoter TATA sequences in gene transcription in eukaryotes. Studies have shown complex binding mechanisms involving helical distortion of DNA. The C-terminal DNA binding domains of TBPs are conserved across species, while the N-terminal domains vary. Crystallographic studies reveal similar structures of TBP-DNA complexes across species, indicating TATA sequence-independent interactions. Research focuses on human TBP's recognition mechanisms for promoter DNA and solution structures of TBP-DNA complexes, using kinetic models and biophysical studies. Studies compare human and yeast TBPs, showing differences in binding affinity, kinetics, and DNA bend angles. The text also discusses the interaction of TBP with DNA sequences, highlighting differences in binding isotherms, kinetics, and DNA bend angles between human and yeast TBPs. The text contrasts different models for TBP-DNA interactions and the involvement of TFIIB in inducing DNA bending. Ongoing research aims to understand the DNA recognition pathways of human and yeast TBPs through thermodynamic and kinetic data analysis.
