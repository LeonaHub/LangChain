The text discusses the importance of maintaining rigorous standards in COVID-19 research, particularly in understanding the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the coagulation cascade. It critiques the experimental design and data analysis of a study by Mast et al., pointing out issues such as using control samples with comorbidities, differences in library preparation methods, and insufficient data depth. The text also highlights discrepancies in gene expression data normalization and analysis, emphasizing the need for proper sequencing depth and normalization in RNA sequencing experiments. It discusses the impact of these methodological flaws on the accuracy and validity of reported gene expression results. The text stresses the importance of accurate characterization of the host response to SARS-CoV-2 and the need for well-designed studies to guide future research in the field.
