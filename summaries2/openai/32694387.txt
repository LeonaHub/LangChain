The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) Subcommittee on Taxonomy recommended a definition of pain in 1978, which has been widely accepted but faced challenges due to evolving understanding of pain. In 2018, a Presidential Task Force was formed to evaluate and potentially revise the definition based on current evidence-based knowledge. The task force, comprising experts in pain-related fields, deliberated for two years and recommended revisions to the definition, which were unanimously accepted by the IASP Council. The discussions highlighted the complexity of defining pain due to its diverse nature and pathophysiologic mechanisms. Criticisms of the current definition included its Cartesian nature and neglect of mind-body interactions. The task force considered feedback from experts and the public, leading to revisions that emphasized pain as an aversive sensory and emotional experience caused by actual or potential tissue injury. The revised definition aims to capture the personal experience of pain and align with modern pain conceptualizations. The text also discusses the distinction between pain and nociception, the importance of considering biological, psychological, and social factors in understanding pain, and the recognition of pain as a personal experience. The revised definition of pain is seen as beneficial for research and patient care, aligning with efforts to advance frameworks for understanding pain.
