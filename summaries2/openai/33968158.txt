Lung cancer is a deadly cancer with high metastasis rates, influenced by proteases secreted by cancer cells. Specific proteases like ubiquitin-specific protease 7 and ST14 are linked to metastasis. Serine proteases like KLK6 and trypsin activate PAR2, promoting lung cancer growth. PAR2 is upregulated in various cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), regulating cell proliferation and migration. DNA methylation in tumor-related genes is observed in lung cancer, impacting cancer development. A study on PAR2 promoter methylation in LUAD cells revealed a reverse correlation with gene expression, suggesting it as a potential biomarker for LUAD progression. Laboratory experiments involved cell transfection, qRT-PCR, Western blot analysis, and MSP to examine promoter methylation. Hypomethylation of the PAR2 promoter in LUAD cells was associated with increased PAR2 expression, promoting cancer progression. Inhibiting methylation enhanced PAR2 expression, further promoting cancer cell activities. Targeting PAR2 promoter methylation could be a therapeutic strategy for LUAD, pending further research on specific methylated sites and PAR2 as a therapeutic target.
