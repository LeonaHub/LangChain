The text discusses the significance of sphingolipids in biological functions and their potential therapeutic applications in treating human diseases. It emphasizes the roles of sphingolipids like sphingomyelin, ceramide, and sphingosine in cellular regulation. The text also explores the use of FTY720 and its derivative AAL-R in treating multiple sclerosis and influenza virus-induced immunopathology. It delves into the regulation of virus replication by sphingosine kinase and S1P lyase, particularly focusing on influenza virus and its interaction with the sphingolipid system. The text highlights the threat posed by influenza viruses, including past pandemics and current strains like H5N1 and H7N9, explaining their mechanisms of infection, replication, and evasion of antiviral drugs. It discusses the impact of S1P lyase and sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) on influenza virus replication, detailing how their modulation affects virus protein expression and infectious virus production. The text also explores the role of sphing
