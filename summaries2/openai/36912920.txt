Popliteal cysts, also known as Baker's cysts, are often associated with knee joint pathologies leading to fluid accumulation and cyst formation. Traditional treatments have high recurrence rates, prompting the use of arthroscopic surgery to excise the cyst wall and valve while addressing intra-articular issues. A study evaluated this technique on 118 patients, finding a 12.4% recurrence rate, mostly asymptomatic, with a correlation between recurrence and severe chondral lesions. The surgery showed a 97.9% success rate with improved functional outcomes. Common intra-articular pathologies included meniscus tears and chondral lesions. Postoperative complications were transient and resolved quickly. The study highlights the effectiveness of arthroscopic treatment for popliteal cysts, emphasizing the importance of managing concomitant lesions to prevent recurrence.
