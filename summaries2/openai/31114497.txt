The text discusses the use of oral anticoagulant therapy for conditions like atrial fibrillation and deep vein thrombosis, focusing on vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) like dabigatran and rivaroxaban. It highlights advantages of DOACs over VKAs, such as rapid onset of action and reduced monitoring needs. The importance of monitoring and preventing bleeding events associated with oral anticoagulant therapy is emphasized, with a study in Italy evaluating preventability of bleeding cases. The study analyzed Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) related to oral anticoagulants, identifying critical criteria related to healthcare professionals' practices for preventable cases. The text also discusses risk factors for bleeding events, drug interactions, and the impact of combined antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy on bleeding risk. The study aims to improve pharmacovigilance activities and promote appropriate use of oral anticoagulants to reduce adverse drug reactions and medication errors.
