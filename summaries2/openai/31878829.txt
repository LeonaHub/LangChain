Keloids are abnormal skin lesions characterized by excessive collagen production and capillary proliferation, more common in individuals with darker skin due to a potential genetic basis. The molecular mechanisms of keloid formation involve hyper-proliferative fibroblasts and up-regulated growth factors like TGFβ. Targeting TGFβ signaling is a potential therapy for keloids, with other pathways like PI3K/Akt/mTOR also contributing to keloid pathogenesis. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) like HOXA11-AS may play a role in keloid formation by regulating cell apoptosis and angiogenesis through the miR-124-3p/TGFβR1 axis. Experimental procedures in a study involved tissue sample collection, cell culture, transfection techniques, and histological examinations. The study identified an inverse relationship between miR-124-3p and HOXA11-AS or TGFβR1 in keloid tissues, suggesting a potential mechanism for keloid development. Further research with larger sample sizes and better-matched groups is needed to validate these findings and explore potential therapeutic interventions for keloid disease.
