Oral cancers, particularly oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), are a significant global health concern, and diagnosing them can be challenging due to the presence of potentially malignant disorders and precancerous lesions in the oral mucosa. Various methods are used for screening and diagnosing oral lesions, including Lugol's iodine staining, non-invasive autofluorescent imaging devices like VELscope and IllumiScan, and narrow band imaging (NBI) magnifying endoscopy. Studies have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods in detecting OSCC and leukoplakia, with findings showing significant differences in optical characteristics between different oral lesions. The IllumiScan device, in particular, has shown promise in distinguishing between normal areas and OSCC, with varying sensitivity and specificity levels reported. Challenges remain in accurately identifying lesions, especially in cases of leukoplakia with a thick keratinized layer. Combining the IllumiScan device with other screening methods is suggested to improve diagnostic accuracy for oral mucosal lesions.
