The text discusses the challenges of global food security due to climate change-induced flooding events, emphasizing the importance of developing flood-tolerant crops to safeguard food production. It delves into the role of ethylene in mediating hypoxia tolerance in plants, particularly through the regulation of hypoxia-responsive genes by ERFVII transcription factors. The study explores how ethylene signaling influences hypoxia acclimation and flooding tolerance in Solanum species, including potato cultivars, bittersweet, eggplant, and tomato. The research highlights the complexity of the relationship between ethylene, ERFVII proteins, and hypoxia-responsive genes, suggesting the need for further research to fully understand these interactions. The text also describes the methods and conditions used for growing and conducting experiments on various plant species to assess waterlogging tolerance and hypoxia survival performance. Statistical analysis was conducted to analyze the data obtained from these experiments.
