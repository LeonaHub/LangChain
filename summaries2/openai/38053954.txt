ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting around 5% of children, with inattention being a core feature associated with impairments in focused attention and inhibition control. Visual attention and eye movements are closely related, with children with ADHD showing atypical eye movements. Quiet Eye (QE) training, which involves optimizing gaze control through skilled model demonstrations, may help reduce attention deficits in individuals with ADHD. A study investigated the effects of QE training on attention in children with ADHD, finding that QE training improved visual attention and cognitive performance, particularly in accuracy and inhibitory control. The study also highlighted the importance of eye fixations in improving motor performance and attention control during visually directed tasks. While the study showed immediate improvements in focused attention, further research on non-pharmacological therapies for ADHD and long-term effects of QE training is recommended.
