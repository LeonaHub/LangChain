Biological invasions, particularly by non-native species, have significant impacts on biodiversity and human well-being. The process of invasion involves introduction, establishment, and dispersal phases, with globalization facilitating the introduction of these species. Managing introduction pathways is crucial in preventing invasions. Factors like climate matching, host availability, suitable habitats, and dispersal vectors influence the establishment and dispersal of non-native species. Developing a risk assessment framework is essential for managing invasive alien species, with tools like network analysis and species distribution models being valuable for evaluating risks. The text focuses on the case of Pine Wilt Nematode (PWN) invasion in China, discussing the impact of climate change on its spread, particularly through insect vectors. Various modeling techniques are used to assess the risks associated with PWN introduction, establishment, and dispersal, considering factors like niche overlap and suitable probabilities under different climate scenarios. The study emphasizes the need for early warning systems, strict quarantine measures, and biological control to manage PWN and its vectors effectively, especially in high-risk regions like northeastern China.
