Soybean is a valuable global crop used in various industries, but faces threats from microbial diseases like charcoal rot caused by Macrophomina phaseolina. Research has explored biocontrol strategies using antifungal metabolites from Pseudomonas strains to combat diseases in soybean plants. The text discusses the impact of diseases like leaf blight and anthracnose on soybean production, caused by species of Cercospora and Colletotrichum, respectively. Colletotrichum fungi produce various secondary metabolites with diverse biological activities, including compounds with cytostatic and anticancer properties. The text details the isolation and characterization of bioactive compounds like truncatenolide and truncatenone from C. truncatum, highlighting their antifungal activity against pathogens like M. phaseolina and C. nicotianae. The study includes experimental procedures, structural elucidation, and biological activity testing of these compounds. Truncatenolide was found to have strong antifungal activity against both M. phaseolina and C. nicotianae, emphasizing its potential as a biocontrol agent. Further research is needed to fully understand the fungicidal capabilities of these compounds and their potential applications in agriculture.
