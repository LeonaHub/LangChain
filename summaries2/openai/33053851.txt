Rubella, also known as German measles, was initially considered mild but was later found to cause congenital defects in newborns if contracted by pregnant women. The discovery of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) led to the development of a rubella vaccine in 1970. The virus has an average incubation period of 14 days and typically presents with a rash on the face and neck. The most significant risk is when the virus infects the fetus through the maternal placenta, particularly in the first trimester, leading to miscarriage or CRS. Efforts have been made globally, including in Italy, to eliminate rubella through vaccination campaigns and surveillance. A study in Florence assessed rubella seroprevalence in children and adolescents, finding high rates of immunity, especially in vaccinated individuals. The study emphasized the importance of maintaining high vaccination coverage to prevent CRS and highlighted the success of vaccination campaigns in the region. Challenges include parental vaccine hesitancy and underreporting of rubella cases. Italy has made MMR vaccination mandatory for school-aged children to address these challenges. Continued monitoring and surveillance are crucial to eliminate rubella and CRS.
