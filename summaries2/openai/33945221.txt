Acetabular fractures are often treated with open reduction and internal fixation, with surgical approaches like the ilioinguinal and modified Stoppa approaches commonly used for anterior acetabular fractures. The pararectus approach, introduced as an alternative by Professor Keel, offers advantages over the ilioinguinal approach, such as reduced incision length, better fracture reduction, and minimal soft tissue damage. A study comparing these approaches found that the pararectus approach had lower incision length, exposure time, and postoperative complications. However, the pararectus approach has limitations in treating certain fractures and carries risks like muscle atrophy and hernia due to innervation damage. Recommendations include considering alternative approaches for specific cases and emphasizing surgical precision. Further research is needed to assess long-term outcomes.
