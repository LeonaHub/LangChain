The text discusses the phases of physiological wound healing and factors influencing the process, such as hypoxia and infections. It emphasizes the importance of systematic wound monitoring and using measurement instruments for accurate evaluation. Various tools like the Norton scale and RESVECH 2.0 are mentioned for assessing wound severity and healing. A study focused on developing a Portuguese version of RESVECH 2.0, involving back translation, expert review, and cognitive debriefing. The study collected data on chronic wounds using RESVECH 2.0, BWAT, and EQ-5D-5L, assessing wound severity and quality of life. The Portuguese version of RESVECH 2.0 showed good reliability and validity, with no significant influence from sociodemographic variables. The study found correlations between RESVECH 2.0 scores and other measurement tools. Chronic wounds were found to impact quality of life, with factors like BMI and nutrition affecting healing. The study highlighted the importance of wound evaluation and the impact of chronic wounds on social exclusion and quality of life. Further research is recommended to assess RESVECH 2.0 in different settings for improved interventions.
