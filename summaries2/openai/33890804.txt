The text discusses the impact of modern technology in medicine, particularly in spine surgery, highlighting the potential for advancements to improve patient care but also increase healthcare costs. It emphasizes the importance of evaluating the value of medical technologies based on their ability to enhance patient care while minimizing costs. Issues such as over-referral, over-imaging, and overdiagnosis in healthcare are addressed, leading to a recent shift towards value-based care. The text also discusses the increasing use and costs of CT and MRI imaging in healthcare, emphasizing the potential for cost savings by avoiding redundant imaging studies and unnecessary radiologist interpretations. It questions the routine use of MRI for cervical spine clearance and the necessity of perioperative hematologic lab testing for all spine surgery patients. The text also explores the use of intraoperative neuromonitoring in spine surgery, highlighting its effectiveness in complex procedures but noting the lack of consistent evidence for its utility in routine surgeries. The text concludes by emphasizing the importance of evaluating the value of both old and new technologies in spine surgery to identify low-value elements and lower overall costs while providing evidence of the impact of new technologies on patient outcomes.
