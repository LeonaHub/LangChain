The text discusses the varying infectivity of enveloped viruses, such as avian sarcoma and leukosis virus (ASLV), in different cell types due to differences in entry efficiency and endosomal pH regulation. Host factors, including interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins like IFITM3, play a role in viral fusion. Studies on ASLV reveal insights into viral entry mechanisms, receptor isoforms, and fusion kinetics. The text highlights the impact of endosomal pH on ASLV fusion, with differences observed between cell types like CV-1 and A549. Factors influencing fusion efficiency include endosome-resident lipids, proteins, and specific inhibitors used to study fusion steps. The study also explores the role of IFITM3 in inhibiting ASLV fusion and its effects on virus internalization and acidification of carrier vesicles. Cell-specific factors, such as differences in endosomal pH regulation and fusion kinetics, are discussed, emphasizing the importance of understanding these processes for studying viral entry and fusion mechanisms. The text also details the experimental methods used, including virus-cell fusion assays, single-virus imaging, endosomal pH measurements, and the impact of IFITM3 expression on ASLV fusion.
