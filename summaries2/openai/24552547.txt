The text discusses the impact of endogenous hormones and environmental chemicals, such as BPA and genistein, on breast cancer risk. Studies have shown that BPA exposure can influence mammary gland development and carcinogenesis, potentially increasing the risk of breast cancer. On the other hand, genistein, found in soy, has been associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer. Research has focused on identifying proteins in rat serum affected by BPA and genistein exposure, aiming to use these proteins as potential biomarkers for carcinogenesis susceptibility. Studies have utilized mass spectrometry to analyze differential protein expressions in response to these chemicals, highlighting the impact on gene and protein expressions in tissues. The text emphasizes the importance of understanding how environmental chemical exposures can impact the serum proteome and contribute to breast cancer development. Studies have identified specific proteins altered by BPA and genistein exposure, with implications for cancer predisposition or prevention. The research underscores the significance of studying the serum proteome in response to environmental chemicals for potential insights into breast cancer mechanisms and biomarker identification.
