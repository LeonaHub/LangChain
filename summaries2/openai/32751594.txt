Thyroid cancer, specifically low-risk papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), has been increasing in developed countries, leading to concerns about overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Traditional surgical approaches have included total thyroidectomy (TT) in Western countries and lobectomy (LT) in Japan. Risk-adapted management based on genetic mutations, such as BRAF V600E and TERT promoter mutations, is being considered for treatment decisions. A study found that TERT promoter mutations were associated with worse outcomes, while BRAF V600E mutations did not significantly impact survival. Patients without TERT promoter mutations may benefit from less extensive surgery. The study suggests individualized treatment approaches may be more beneficial for PTC patients. The 2015 ATA guidelines expanded indications for LT, but TT is still commonly chosen in the US. Genetic markers can help predict PTC prognosis and guide treatment decisions. The study used molecular tests to detect mutations and found that TERT promoter mutations could guide surgical decisions for PTC patients. The study methodology involved analyzing genetic mutations using PCR, sequencing, and statistical analysis. Overall, the study suggests that genetic mutations, particularly TERT promoter mutations, could help prevent unnecessary surgeries and reduce complications for PTC patients.
