The text discusses the importance of growth as an indicator of infant health and nutrition, particularly in relation to the addition of probiotics to infant formula. The European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) reviewed studies on probiotic-supplemented formula and concluded that it did not raise safety concerns regarding growth. The text highlights the need for updated data on the efficacy of using probiotic-supplemented formula and outlines the objective of a review to determine the effects of specific probiotic strains on the growth of healthy infants. The study focused on the effects of probiotic supplementation on growth, development, and anthropometry in infants. The text discusses a systematic review of randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of infant formula supplemented with probiotics on infant growth, including trials assessing formulae with different protein contents and types of probiotics. The review found that B lactis supplementation resulted in similar growth to unsupplemented infants, while limited data suggested that infants who received LGG-supplemented formula grew better. However, there were limitations in the studies, such as unequal groups at the start and unclear mechanisms for the effects observed. The text also mentions recommendations from scientific organizations regarding sample sizes and study durations to accurately assess growth. Further research is needed to determine the impact of different protein levels in infant formula on growth and potential anti-obesity effects.
