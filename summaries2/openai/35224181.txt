The text discusses the importance of physical activity for health and the challenges in meeting recommended guidelines, such as engaging in 10,000 steps per day. It highlights the potential of technology-based interventions, particularly those incorporating social comparison, to increase physical activity levels. Studies using Fitbit challenges with confederates show that exposure to social comparison information can influence participants' daily steps, with some individuals responding positively to competition while others may feel discouraged. The text emphasizes the variability in how individuals react to social comparison and the need for further research to understand the impact of exposure to different performance levels on physical activity. Limitations in the studies, such as the lack of quantitative data on syncing frequency and challenges in controlling real-time similarity between participant and confederate steps, are also discussed. Overall, the text suggests that competitive arrangements like Fitbit challenges can increase daily steps, but their effectiveness may vary based on individual factors and challenge contexts.
