Pulp capping is a dental procedure where capping materials are applied to exposed vital pulp to stimulate dentin formation. Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) is commonly used, but research has explored using Portland cement as a cost-effective alternative. A study evaluated a new pulp capping material made from Portland cement, bismuth oxide, and calcium hydroxide, comparing it to MTA. Testing included setting time, pH, and strength properties. Results showed variations in setting times and strengths among materials, with MTA having the lowest initial setting time and highest compressive strength. Portland cement with bismuth oxide had the highest push out bond strength. The addition of calcium hydroxide to Portland cement enhanced antimicrobial and mineralization effects. Overall, adding calcium hydroxide to Portland cement can create a new pulp capping material with acceptable properties.
