Aging affects neuronal properties, leading to declines in excitability and synaptic function, resulting in sensory, motor deficits, and memory loss. Studies on Aplysia snails have shown age-related declines in excitability, with serotonin playing a role in memory formation and maintenance through protein kinase A and protein kinase C signaling pathways. Short-term facilitation in neurons involves serotonin activating adenylyl cyclase, leading to enhanced neurotransmitter release and synaptic strengthening. Long-term facilitation requires prolonged PKA activation, leading to transcription and translation processes. Aging in Aplysia affects serotonin-induced changes in neuron excitability, with impaired responses in aged individuals partially restored by PKA and PKC activation. Experimental procedures involved whole-cell voltage clamp recordings of isolated sensory neurons and intracellular recordings of tail sensory neurons in Aplysia. The study also explored the effects of PMA and dbcAMP treatments on aged sensory neurons, showing promising results in
