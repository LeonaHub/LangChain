The text discusses the development and implementation of the Shared Decision Making â€” Renal Supportive Care (SDM-RSC) intervention to improve end-of-life care for dialysis patients with kidney failure. The HIGHway project aims to scale up the SDM-RSC intervention and integrate advance care planning (ACP) into routine care for dialysis patients. The project involves training social workers and nurses in ACP, utilizing a computer application for documentation, and engaging stakeholders. The project focuses on person-centered approaches, empathy, and collaboration with dialysis organizations. Recruitment for the project is ongoing, with plans to enroll social workers and nurses for training in ACP conversations. Success will be measured by the adoption and effective use of the ACP approach, with data collected on various outcomes related to ACP conversations. The project aims to enroll 60 social workers or nurses and provide ACP services to approximately 1,600 patients. The importance of ACP discussions for dialysis patients is highlighted, as many patients want to discuss their end-of-life treatment preferences but often do not. The project aims to address barriers to ACP implementation and make it a routine part of patient care in dialysis centers.
