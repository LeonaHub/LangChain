Breast cancer is a prevalent and deadly disease with a high relapse rate and chemoresistance, leading researchers to seek new chemopreventive agents. Environmental pollutants like DMBA and TCDD contribute to genetic mutations that can cause breast cancer by activating the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and the CYP1 pathway. Metformin, an anti-hyperglycemic drug, has shown anti-cancer properties by inhibiting the AhR/CYP1A1 pathway, protecting against breast carcinogenesis. Studies in rats and cell cultures have demonstrated that metformin decreases the expression of cancer-related genes and promotes apoptosis, inhibits cell cycle proliferation, and reduces DNA damage induced by carcinogens. Metformin also reduces mammosphere formation, suggesting a potential chemoprevention strategy against breast cancer. Further research is needed to explore metformin's chemopreventive effects in animal models.
