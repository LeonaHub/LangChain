Cardiac arrest is a leading global cause of death, often presenting with ventricular fibrillation. Survival rates decline rapidly post-arrest, underscoring the critical role of prompt and effective CPR. While past studies focused on the heart's electrical or mechanical activities separately, there is a growing interest in analyzing both concurrently to gain a more comprehensive view of cardiac function during arrest. The text explores the electrical and mechanical behaviors of the cardiovascular system through ECG and PPG signals, respectively, as behaviors of interconnected yet distinct subsystems. It introduces a novel approach, cross recurrence quantitative analysis (CRQA), to capture the complex dynamics of these systems by assessing their coupling. The study aims to investigate the coupling of electrical and mechanical processes during CPR after cardiac arrest using CRQA, analyzing ECG and PPG signals from healthy Bama pigs. The research delves into the preprocessing and analysis of raw signals, dividing data into periods like Baseline, CA, CPR, and ROSC. Parameters from recurrence plots and cross recurrence plots are computed to quantify the dynamic correlation of signals, revealing significant differences in RQA and CRQA parameters across CPR stages. The findings suggest that nonlinear dynamics of ECG and PPG parameters are closely tied to cardiac function status during CPR, with potential implications for evaluating and predicting CPR outcomes. The study emphasizes the importance of understanding changes in electrical-mechanical coupling as a quality indicator for CPR progress and highlights the need for further research to validate these findings for clinical application.
