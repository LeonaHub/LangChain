Eating disorders are severe mental illnesses characterized by abnormal eating habits that can negatively impact physical and mental health, with prevalence rates varying globally. Early detection of abnormal eating behaviors is crucial in preventing the development of eating disorders, but in China, there is a lack of reliable screening tools for identifying symptoms in children. The Childrenâ€™s Eating Attitude Test (ChEAT) is highlighted as a valuable tool designed to measure problematic eating attitudes and behaviors in children aged 8-13 years. A study in Shanghai, China, involving 906 children, investigated the psychometric properties of the ChEAT in this population. Results showed that 10.71% of children had positive eating disorder symptoms based on a cut-off point of 20 on the ChEAT-26 scale. The study found good internal consistency, reliability, and validity of the Chinese version of the ChEAT, with differences in eating behaviors observed across genders and BMI groups. The study suggested that the Chinese version of the ChEAT is a reliable tool for assessing eating attitudes and behaviors in Chinese children, providing a basis for further research in this area.
