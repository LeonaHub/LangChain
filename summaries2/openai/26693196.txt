Glaucoma, particularly Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG), is a significant cause of irreversible blindness globally, often diagnosed late leading to severe eye damage. Public education and regular eye checks are crucial for early detection. POAG is a major public health concern, especially among black populations, with a higher prevalence in the Caribbean and Ghana. Family history and age are key risk factors for developing POAG. A study in Ghana assessed awareness and knowledge of glaucoma in patients aged 40 and above, finding that education level significantly influenced awareness. The study emphasized the importance of early diagnosis to prevent blindness and the need for educational strategies. Awareness of glaucoma was higher among those with formal education, certain occupations, and higher income levels. The study recommended improved education programs to enhance knowledge and understanding of glaucoma, especially among lower socioeconomic populations.
