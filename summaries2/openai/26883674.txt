Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder affecting 4% of adults, characterized by intermittent hypoxia, sleep fragmentation, and excessive daytime sleepiness. OSA has been linked to various comorbidities, particularly cardiovascular disease (CVD), due to malfunctions in neural, hormonal, thrombotic, and metabolic pathways. The relationship between OSA and dyslipidaemia, a metabolic disorder associated with CVD, has been studied extensively, but results have been conflicting due to factors like small sample sizes and oversimplified assumptions. Recent studies have revealed a nonlinear, multistage relationship between OSA severity and dyslipidemia, emphasizing the need for a more comprehensive understanding of their interplay in CVD development. New statistical models and analyses have been developed to explore these complex relationships, providing insights that traditional linear models could not capture. Further research is needed to explore the implications of different indices in OSA severity and lipid metabolism, with potential clinical implications for the management of dyslipidemia in OSA patients.
