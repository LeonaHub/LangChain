Buffaloes are a valuable species globally, particularly in tropical environments, due to their heat stress resistance and high birth rates. However, their milk production per hectare is lower compared to cattle. Incorporating leguminous trees like Leucaena leucocephala, Albizia lebbeck, Gliricidia sepium, and Moringa oleifera in silvopastoral systems can enhance feed quality for buffaloes and reduce environmental stress. These trees offer high nutritional value, improved degradation rates, and protein digestibility, making them sustainable feed sources, especially in the dry season. Research in Cuba evaluated buffalo preferences for different tree leaves, with A. lebbeck and L. leucocephala being the most consumed. The study analyzed the consumption and chemical composition of fodder, finding variations in dry matter, protein, fiber, and energy content among tree species. A. lebbeck and L. leucocephala provided higher nutritional values compared to M. oleifera and G. sepium. Understanding animal feeding behavior and preferences is crucial for designing optimal ruminant diets. Leguminous trees contribute significantly to buffaloes' daily protein intake, with A. lebbeck identified as a key protein source. Factors influencing tree consumption include digestibility, secondary metabolites, and effects on ruminal parameters. M. oleifera, despite its potential as a feed alternative, may have lower consumption due to anti-nutritional factors and wilting. Further research is recommended to explore the impact of secondary metabolites on feed intake and identify suitable tree species for buffalo production in tropical regions.
