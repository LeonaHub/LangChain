Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal lung disease that requires early diagnosis for effective treatment. Current methods like forced vital capacity (FVC) and high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) have limitations in predicting prognosis. Functional Respiratory Imaging (FRI), a technology using HRCT scans and computational fluid dynamics, shows promise in assessing lung health more sensitively. A study on IPF patients evaluated FRI parameters to predict FVC decline and assess treatment efficacy. Results showed correlations between FRI parameters and lung function tests, with lower lobes being more affected in advanced stages. Quantitative computed tomography (qCT) was also discussed as a potential biomarker for disease progression in IPF, offering advantages over FVC testing. An automated method for quantifying traction bronchiectasis was highlighted for capturing disease-related information not detected by conventional tests. FRI was suggested as a more sensitive tool for predicting disease severity and progression in IPF patients, emphasizing the importance of incorporating regional lung structure information for improved patient stratification and treatment outcomes.
