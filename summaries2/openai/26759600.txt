The text discusses the global obesity epidemic, emphasizing its impact on health and society, including comorbidities like type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. It explores the role of the gut microbiota in obesity, influenced by genetic and environmental factors such as diet and physical activity. The interaction between genetics, environment, and the gut microbiota is crucial in understanding the obesity epidemic. Studies have shown differences in gut microbiota composition across populations, impacting energy extraction and fat storage. The text also highlights the relationship between diet, physical activity, and the gut microbiome, with dietary habits shaping microbial communities. Research suggests that physical activity can impact gut microbiota diversity. The epidemiologic transition model is proposed as a framework to explore the associations between gut microbiota, obesity, and environmental factors. Further large-scale studies are recommended to investigate these relationships globally.
