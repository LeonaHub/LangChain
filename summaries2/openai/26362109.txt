Molybdenum is essential for living organisms and is found in the molybdenum cofactor (Moco) in various biological systems. Moco-containing enzymes, known as molybdopterin enzymes, play a crucial role in catalyzing redox reactions. Eukaryotic organisms typically belong to the sulfite oxidase (SO) or xanthine oxidase (XO) families, while prokaryotic organisms can be part of all three families. The DMSO reductase (DMSOR) family of enzymes exhibit significant variability in the composition of the molybdenum (Mo) active site and function under anaerobic conditions. Nitrate reductases are enzymes responsible for the initial reductive steps of the nitrogen cycle and can be classified into dissimilatory periplasmic nitrate reductases (Nap), respiratory membrane-bound nitrate reductases (Nar), and assimilatory cytoplasmic nitrate reductases (Nas). Crystallographic studies have provided insights into the structure and function of these enzymes. The NarGH complex is
