Breast cancer is a common malignancy among women, with treatments including radiation, chemotherapeutics, and surgery. Nanoformulation of chemotherapeutics, such as nedaplatin, can improve drug properties and reduce side effects. Chitosan nanoparticles have been studied for drug delivery due to their biocompatibility and biodegradability. Researchers have developed nanoparticles loaded with betaine and nedaplatin for breast cancer treatment, showing potential anticancer effects in cell and animal models. An experimental study involving female Wistar rats and MCF-7 cells investigated the effects of various agents on tumor size reduction, with statistical analyses conducted using ANOVA. The study demonstrated that PEGylated chitosan nanoparticles loaded with betulin and norcantharidin showed significant cytotoxicity against MCF-7 cells. The nanoparticles exhibited high entrapment efficiencies for drugs and stable release profiles. The study also highlighted the synergistic effects of combining drugs in nanoparticles, with PEGylated chitosan nanoparticles showing higher cytotoxicity than non-PEGylated ones. In vivo studies in a breast cancer-bearing rat model showed a significant reduction in tumor size percentage in groups treated with nanoparticles compared to the untreated group. The most effective treatment, BT-ND/PEG-CS NPs, resulted in a 90% reduction in tumor size, indicating their potential as a therapeutic strategy for breast cancer treatment.
