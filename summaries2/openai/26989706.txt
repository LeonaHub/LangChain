The text discusses the increasing prevalence of asthma and allergies in industrialized countries and the role of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in regulating allergic reactions and recognizing respiratory pathogens. A study in Iran investigated TLR2 expression in asthmatic individuals compared to healthy subjects, focusing on soluble TLR2 levels in peripheral blood and sputum leukocytes. The study found that asthmatics had lower sTLR2 levels in serum and sputum compared to healthy controls, with no significant differences based on asthma severity. Additionally, TLR2 mRNA expression in sputum leukocytes was lower in asthmatics. The text suggests a potential link between sTLR2 concentrations and asthma severity, indicating sTLR2 as a potential marker for asthma severity. Further research is needed to clarify the relationship between sTLR2 levels and asthma severity, as well as the impact of microbial exposure on TLR2 expression.
