Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a deadly cancer often diagnosed at an advanced stage with high recurrence rates after surgical resection. BORIS, a DNA-binding protein, is overexpressed in various cancers, including HCC, and linked to poor prognosis. SOCS3, an inhibitor of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, is frequently hypermethylated in cancers like HCC, promoting cell growth and migration. Studies aim to clarify the prognostic value of BORIS and SOCS3 in HCC patients post-resection. Research shows high BORIS expression and low SOCS3 expression correlate with poor survival outcomes in HCC. The combined expression of BORIS and SOCS3 may offer better prognostic value, with potential for BORIS as a therapeutic target in HCC treatment. Further investigation is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms of this relationship.
