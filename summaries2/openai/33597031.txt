Endoscopic nasopharyngectomy is a preferred surgical approach for local, recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (rNPC) due to lower morbidity rates compared to re-irradiation. Recent studies have shown favorable short-term survival rates with this technique, but long-term outcomes are still limited. A study at Stanford Medical Center aimed to provide updated 5-year outcomes for rNPC patients in North America who underwent endoscopic nasopharyngectomy. The study involved post-operative surveillance, disease recurrence tracking, and management with repeat surgeries if needed to achieve cure and improve survival. The study reported an 84.6% 5-year overall survival rate, with patients at early disease stages having higher survival rates. Complications post-surgery were generally minor, with late complications including osteoradionecrosis. Endoscopic nasopharyngectomy has shown comparable outcomes to reirradiation with IMRT and open surgical techniques for low rT staged rNPC. The study also highlighted the benefits of endoscopic surgery over traditional approaches, emphasizing the importance of considering tumor resectability in treatment decisions. Close surveillance and prompt management of recurrences were deemed crucial for better long-term tumor control.
