Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are converted by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes into oxylipin metabolites, such as hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs). These metabolites have important roles in various diseases, with EETs and HETEs having opposing functions. Fish oil supplements containing ω-3 PUFAs have beneficial effects, potentially reducing pain perception, blood pressure, and angiogenesis. The text explores the biological roles of ω-hydroxy PUFAs derived from EPA and DHA compared to the well-studied 20-HETE derived from ARA, which has been linked to detrimental effects in diseases like hypertension and cancer. The study discusses the synthesis of these compounds and their potential use as standards for metabolite analysis. The text also describes a study on the pain-inducing effects of specific metabolites in rats, showing that 20-HETE induced pain while 20-HEPE and 22-HDoHE did not. Further experiments revealed that 20-HEPE and 22-HDoHE were more potent in stimulating TRPV1 channels compared to 20-HETE. The study suggests that ω-3 hydroxy metabolites may have therapeutic properties due to their TRPV1 agonist activity without inducing pain like 20-HETE, emphasizing the need for further research into their biological roles.
