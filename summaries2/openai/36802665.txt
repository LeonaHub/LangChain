Protein homeostasis is essential for cell function and is linked to human diseases when disrupted. Protein ubiquitination, involving the attachment of ubiquitin molecules to proteins, is a key mechanism for regulating protein levels and cellular processes. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) like USP21 play a crucial role in this process. USP21, a member of the USP subfamily, is involved in apoptosis, DNA repair, and signal transduction, making it a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment. Efforts to develop small-molecule inhibitors for USP21 have been challenging, but a recent study successfully identified a highly potent and selective inhibitor, BAY-805. This compound was optimized through a hit-to-lead process, resulting in derivatives with improved potency and selectivity against USP21. Compound 21 emerged as a promising chemical probe, demonstrating strong inhibitory activity on USP21 in both biochemical and cellular assays. It showed high selectivity for USP21 and met the criteria for a chemical probe with good physicochemical properties. Compound 21 was found to enhance the NF-ÎºB pathway but did not exhibit antiprol
