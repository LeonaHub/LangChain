Gout is a chronic disease caused by MSU crystal deposition in joints, leading to painful flares. The NLRP3 inflammasome plays a key role in MSU crystal-induced inflammation, with gout flares occurring due to its activation triggered by various factors. Gout flares often happen during late night and early morning, linked to the circadian clock system. A study investigated the impact of MSU crystals on the circadian clock in immune cells, finding alterations in clock components in response to crystal exposure. Specifically, MSU crystals reduced BMAL1 and REV-ERBα levels in macrophages, affecting NLRP3 inflammasome activation. BMAL1 levels influenced inflammasome activity, with knockdown increasing caspase 1 activity and IL-1β secretion, while overexpression had the opposite effect. The study also explored the effects of heme and REV-ERBα antagonist on inflammasome activity. Overall, the findings suggest a link between circadian rhythms, immune responses, and gout flares, with potential implications for understanding and managing inflammatory conditions.
