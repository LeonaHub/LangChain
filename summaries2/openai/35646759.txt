A study conducted in Thailand aimed to identify factors influencing COVID-19 prevention behaviors among the population. The study utilized the PRECEDE model and found that social support, age, flu-like symptoms, gender, perceived risk of exposure, lockdown policy, and residential area were significant factors influencing preventive behaviors. Social support was identified as the most influential factor. The study recommended further research to explore additional variables that may impact preventive behaviors and develop tailored strategies to encourage adherence to preventive measures. Understanding these factors can help policymakers and healthcare professionals develop effective strategies to promote COVID-19 prevention behaviors, with different strategies needed for urban and rural populations. Education level and career were not found to be significant factors, but health literacy and access to information were linked to engaging in more preventive actions.
