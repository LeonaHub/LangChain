Advancements in separating semiconducting from metallic single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have enabled the production of high-purity dispersions of semiconducting SWNTs for use in printed electronics, leading to the fabrication of field-effect transistors (FETs) with high carrier mobilities and on-conductivities. The focus has shifted towards understanding the impact of polydispersity in semiconducting nanotubes on charge injection and transport in random networks, as well as the potential advantages of single-chirality networks. Near-infrared electroluminescence is used to study charge transport, revealing that transport primarily occurs through nanotubes with the smallest bandgaps. The behavior of SWNTs in charge transport and the impact of their bandgaps on device characteristics are discussed, emphasizing the dominance of small-bandgap SWNTs in charge transport. The text details the preparation of SWNT dispersions and fabrication of FETs, highlighting the importance of tailored nanotube networks for future transistors. The study investigates different types of semiconducting SWNT networks obtained through dispersion with conjugated polymers, focusing on energy transfer dynamics and charge carrier distribution. The text also discusses the
