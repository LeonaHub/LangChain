Postnatal depression (PND) is a common issue among new mothers and can have significant impacts on the mother-infant relationship, infant brain development, and long-term child outcomes. The quality of the mother-infant relationship is crucial for child development, and interventions targeting mother-infant difficulties following PND are essential. The HUGS program is a brief intervention designed to enhance relationships between mothers with PND and their infants, with a focus on improving mother-infant interactions. A randomized controlled trial is being conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the HUGS program, with outcomes including improvements in mother-infant interaction, maternal parenting stress, infant behavior, and developmental milestones. The study protocol involves screening women for depression, random assignment to receive either the HUGS program or an attention placebo, and using established outcome measures to assess the intervention's impact. The study emphasizes the importance of early intervention to prevent long-term consequences on infant development and highlights the potential benefits of the HUGS program in addressing postnatal depression and relationship difficulties.
