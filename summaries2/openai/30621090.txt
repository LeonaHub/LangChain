The text emphasizes the significance of heterosis in agricultural production and the necessity for research to identify plant or animal varieties that display beneficial heterosis when crossed. It discusses hypotheses like dominance, over-dominance, and epistasis to explain the mechanistic bases of heterosis and how advancements in genome-wide methods have improved the understanding of heterosis at the molecular level. The text highlights the use of transcriptome-wide methods to analyze heterosis in various species, particularly in chickens, for traits like growth, egg production, and mortality rate. It describes studies that utilized RNA-seq data to investigate gene expression patterns in different chicken lines and crosses, identifying non-additive heterosis effects and differences in gene expression related to immunity and metabolism. The text also discusses the role of gene regulation mechanisms in heterosis, with both cis- and trans-regulatory elements contributing to heterosis in plants and animals. Overall, the text underscores the importance of studying gene expression patterns to unravel the molecular basis of heterosis and its implications for agricultural production.
