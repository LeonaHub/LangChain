The text emphasizes the significance of energy-saving and environmentally friendly industries, particularly in the context of lightweight high-speed vehicles. It discusses the challenges of welding T-joints in high-strength steel sandwich panels, highlighting the limitations of current methods like laser lap deep welding. To address these challenges, a flux bands constricting arc (FBCA) welding method is proposed, offering advantages such as lower heat input and improved weld width. The text delves into the behavior of the arc in narrow gap welding and explores various innovative systems and methods developed to tackle these challenges. It also discusses the impact of welding current and arc voltage on arc behavior and fusion in welding processes, emphasizing the importance of determining optimal process parameters for stable welding. The use of flux bands in FBCA welding is shown to stabilize the arc burning position, improve arc shape, and enhance arc stability in ultra-narrow gap welding. Additionally, the text details the impact of flux bands on arc heat, penetration, metal transfer characteristics, and overall welding process in FBCA welding, highlighting their role in increasing arc stability and improving welding outcomes.
