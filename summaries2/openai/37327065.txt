Sepsis is a critical issue in healthcare, leading to high mortality rates and frequent ICU admissions. Early identification of sepsis is crucial for patient survival, but it remains challenging, especially in the prehospital setting. Prehospital interventions, such as fluid administration, have been linked to increased survival chances for septic patients arriving via EMS. However, there is a need for better education and standardized protocols among EMS clinicians to improve sepsis recognition and treatment. Various studies have evaluated the use of Early Warning Scores (EWS) for prehospital sepsis identification, but there is inconsistency in their performance. Some EWS, like qSOFA and MEWS, have shown inconsistent results across studies. Experts suggest caution in relying solely on EWS for sepsis identification in the prehospital setting and recommend exploring new areas of research, such as vital signs and biomarkers like EtCO2 monitoring. Standardizing prehospital care and interventions, along with improving sepsis education for clinicians, are crucial for enhancing prehospital sepsis management. Prospective modeling and real-time data feedback for EMS personnel could further improve clinical care for septic patients.
