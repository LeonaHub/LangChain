Workplace bullying is a prevalent issue that can have severe consequences for both individuals and organizations, including negative impacts on physical and mental health, productivity, and even suicidal behavior. Studies have shown a strong association between workplace bullying and suicidal ideation, with the integrated motivational-volitional model providing a theoretical framework for understanding this relationship. A meta-analysis revealed that individuals exposed to workplace bullying were more likely to report suicidal thoughts and behaviors, with a lasting impact on mental health. Various moderators and mediators influencing this association were identified, emphasizing the need to address workplace bullying to prevent negative outcomes. The transition from suicidal ideation to attempts after exposure to workplace bullying was also discussed, highlighting the importance of long-term monitoring and intervention. Future research should focus on combining multiple methods and longitudinal designs to gain a comprehensive understanding of this relationship.
