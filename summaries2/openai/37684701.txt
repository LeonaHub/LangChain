Aedes aegypti is a significant global vector responsible for transmitting arboviruses such as dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. Originally from Africa, this species has adapted to urban areas and human habitats, preferring artificial water containers for breeding and humans as blood meal sources. Genetic studies have shown significant differentiation between ancestral African populations and those outside of Africa, with high genetic diversity observed even at a microgeographical scale. Understanding the factors that influence the population structure of Ae. aegypti is crucial for disease prevention and control. Studies in various locations in Benin have focused on the genetic and morphometric characteristics of Ae. aegypti populations, revealing high genetic diversity and variations in wing size and shape among different landscape types. The studies suggest that factors like habitat diversity, urbanization, and environmental conditions impact genetic variability and morphological diversity in Ae. aegypti populations. Further research is needed to validate hypotheses regarding the fine-scale distribution of populations in Africa. Despite limitations, these studies contribute to a better understanding of the genetic and morphological diversity of this medically important vector.
