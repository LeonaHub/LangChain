The text discusses the concept of "double diabetes" in children, where features of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes coexist, leading to challenges in diagnosis and management. It emphasizes the importance of measuring C-peptide levels in type 1 diabetes patients to estimate residual insulin secretion, which can impact metabolic control and complications. The text also explores the phenomenon of partial remission in type 1 diabetes, highlighting efforts to preserve beta-cell function during this period. Studies have investigated the relationship between body mass index (BMI), insulin resistance, inflammation, and pancreatic beta-cell function in children with diabetes, finding correlations between BMI and C-peptide levels. Higher BMI has been associated with increased C-peptide levels at diagnosis but a decline over time, impacting insulin requirements and metabolic control. The text also discusses the impact of obesity-related inflammation on beta-cell function and the potential benefits of therapeutic interventions targeting the immune system to preserve beta-cell function in type 1 diabetes. Further research is needed to explore the complex interactions between BMI, inflammation, and beta-cell function in children with diabetes.
