Lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the SLC7A7 gene, leading to dysfunction of the y + LAT‐1 protein. Patients with LPI can present with various symptoms, including protein aversion, failure to thrive, hyperammonemia, and hepatomegaly. Kidney disease is a common complication of LPI, with manifestations such as proteinuria and elevated serum cystatin C levels. However, renal tubular acidosis (RTA) and Fanconi syndrome are rare complications. A case report describes a 47-year-old Japanese woman with LPI who presented with RTA/Fanconi syndrome and rickets in childhood, showcasing the diverse clinical manifestations of the condition. The patient had a complex medical history, including various complications such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia, deficiencies, cataracts, epilepsy, and chronic kidney disease. Treatment involved supplementation with vitamin D3, phosphate, and bicarbonate. Genetic analysis is crucial for diagnosing LPI, as symptoms can resemble other conditions like RTA/Fanconi syndrome. High citrulline levels in newborn screening can be an early indicator of LPI. Kidney involvement in LPI is characterized by nonspecific proximal tubular damage with nephrocalcinosis and various glomerular lesions. Renal tubular damage in LPI may affect both distal and proximal tubules. A case study focused on renal tubular abnormalities, suggesting dysfunction in the endocytosis-lysosome pathway leading to severe renal tubular dysfunction. The study was conducted ethically, with informed consent obtained from all patients.
