The text discusses the complexity of pain pathways and the importance of using in vivo and in vitro models in preclinical pain research. It highlights the increasing use of human dorsal root ganglion (hDRG) neurons in studying neuropathic pain and the potential for these models to validate drug targets. The text also emphasizes the challenges and opportunities in studying human sensory neurons, including induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology for modeling pain disorders. It discusses the importance of standardized culture conditions, the impact of genetic differences on iPSC-derived sensory neurons, and the need for accessible repositories of pain-associated iPSC lines. The text also mentions the significance of considering age in pain research, the value of multicellular systems, and the benefits of three-dimensional organoids for studying sensory neurons and their interactions. Overall, it stresses the need to understand the strengths and limitations of different models to advance our understanding of pain biology effectively.
