Iron-based nanoparticles, particularly iron oxide nanoparticles, are extensively used in various fields due to their unique properties. In the medical industry, these nanoparticles find applications in MRI, MPI, drug delivery, and hyperthermia. Studies have shown that the effects of iron nanoparticles on living cells are concentration-dependent, with low concentrations promoting cell growth and higher concentrations potentially being toxic. Iron nanoparticles can impact cell communities like biofilms by affecting cell surface features and adhesion capabilities. They have been observed to reduce biofilm formation in microalgae by attaching to cell surfaces through various interactions. The presence of iron nanoparticles can affect the growth and metabolic states of aquatic microorganisms, such as microalgae, which play a crucial role in ecological systems. Iron oxide nanoparticles coated with l-lysine were synthesized and characterized in a study involving Chlorella vulgaris cells. The nanoparticles exhibited super-paramagnetic properties and were found to interact with microalgal cells, influencing biofilm formation in a concentration- and exposure time-dependent manner. Lower concentrations of lysine-coated iron oxide nanoparticles promoted biofilm formation, while higher concentrations had an inhibitory effect. The study highlighted the importance of nanoparticle type and concentration in modulating biofilm formation, with iron nanoparticles at low concentrations promoting microbial cell growth and biofilm formation. The toxicity of iron oxide nanoparticles was attributed
