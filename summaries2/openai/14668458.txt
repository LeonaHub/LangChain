Chronic allograft nephropathy is a common cause of kidney transplant failure, characterized by progressive renal dysfunction and specific histologic changes. The pathophysiology of this condition is complex, involving factors such as immunologic responses, ischemia, and nephrotoxicity from medications like calcineurin inhibitors. Studies have shown that chronic allograft nephropathy can evolve over time, with distinct phases of injury contributing to its development. Factors such as acute rejection, subclinical rejection, and calcineurin-inhibitor nephrotoxicity play significant roles in the progression of chronic allograft nephropathy. Monitoring and managing rejection episodes are crucial in preventing long-term damage to transplanted kidneys. While calcineurin inhibitors are effective in preventing acute rejection, their long-term nephrotoxic effects pose challenges, suggesting the need for alternative immunosuppressive strategies. A two-stage treatment approach, involving initial potent therapy with a calcineurin inhibitor followed by non-nephrotoxic immunosuppression, may be beneficial in preserving kidney function post-transplantation. Further research is needed to determine the optimal clinical approach for preventing chronic allograft nephropathy and improving long-term outcomes in kidney transplant recipients.
