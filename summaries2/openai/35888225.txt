The text emphasizes the importance of surface texture in manufacturing processes and the impact it has on the functional properties of machined elements. It discusses the errors that can occur during surface texture measurement, including those related to measurement methods, equipment, and interpretation of results. The study focuses on the effects of errors on surface texture parameters, particularly when using optical methods for measurement. The research involved analyzing various surface treatments and their impact on surface textures and parameters. Changes in parameters like skewness, kurtosis, and extreme peak height were observed, with some parameters being more stable than others. The text also discusses the impact of repetitive measurements on surface parameters and the stability of different parameters after abrasive blasting, lapping, and grinding processes. It highlights the importance of understanding how different processes affect surface textures and parameters, as well as the need for proper measurement procedures
