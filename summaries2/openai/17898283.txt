The text discusses a study on glaucoma in monkeys, focusing on the optic nerve head (ONH) and connective tissue damage related to intraocular pressure (IOP). The research involves 3D reconstructions of monkey ONHs with early experimental glaucoma, highlighting changes in the lamina cribrosa, scleral flange, and peripapillary sclera. The study aims to quantify these tissues to identify glaucomatous damage before visual field loss occurs. By creating high-resolution 3D reconstructions and analyzing measurements of various structures, the research aims to understand the biomechanical behavior of ONH tissues and factors contributing to individual susceptibility to glaucoma. The study found differences in the thickness and position of the lamina cribrosa, scleral flange, and peripapillary sclera between normal eyes and eyes with experimental glaucoma, with variations observed among monkeys. The findings suggest that permanent deformation of these tissues occurs in the early stages of glaucomatous damage. The study also discusses the importance of understanding the relationship between connective tissue thickness and axonal susceptibility in glaucoma. The research aims to provide insights into the biomechanical factors contributing to individual susceptibility to glaucoma and suggests that changes in deep nerve structures could serve as markers for tracking disease progression.
