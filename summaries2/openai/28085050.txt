Alzheimer's disease is a degenerative brain disease with significant public health implications, affecting millions in the U.S. The etiology of Alzheimer's is complex, involving genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Mutations in the MTHFR gene can lead to enzyme deficiency, contributing to neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's. Studies suggest impaired MTHFR enzyme activity increases Alzheimer's risk. Chronic air pollution exposure may also play a role in Alzheimer's development. Meta-analyses explore the association between MTHFR gene polymorphisms and Alzheimer's risk, with conflicting results in different populations. The TT genotype is associated with increased Alzheimer's risk in some populations, while the CC genotype may reduce risk. Air pollution levels impact MTHFR genotypes and Alzheimer's risk, with higher pollution linked to increased TT genotype percentages. Geographic variations in MTHFR genotypes and Alzheimer's risk are observed, with some regions showing higher risks associated with specific genotypes. The association between MTHFR polymorphisms and Alzheimer's risk is influenced by gene-environment interactions, particularly with air pollution. Further research is needed to understand these relationships and develop preventive strategies for Alzheimer's in polluted areas.
