Exposure to radiation can lead to vascular endothelial changes in sensitive organs, causing inflammation, altered gene expression, and decreased barrier function. Restoring normal endothelial function is crucial for survival in acute radiation syndromes, but survivors may develop delayed multi-organ morbidities known as DEARE. Vascular dysfunction is common in radiation-sensitive tissues like the lung, kidneys, heart, and brain. The text explores the role of Delta-like ligand 4 (Dll4) in mediating long-term vascular alterations post-radiation, using a consomic rat model with reduced Dll4 expression. Studies show that Dll4-low rats are less susceptible to radiation-induced vascular dysfunction and have improved survival compared to Dll4-high rats. Imaging techniques like near-infrared (NIR) imaging and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI are used to track changes in vascular permeability. The research suggests that Dll4 expression levels play a significant role in vascular recovery and protection against radiation-induced vascular injury. Targeting Dll4 may be a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent pathological vascular remodeling post-radiation injury. Further studies are needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying long-term endothelial dysfunction after radiation exposure.
