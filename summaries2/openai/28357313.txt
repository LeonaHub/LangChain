The text discusses the synthesis and evaluation of ergosterone-triazol hybrid molecules as potential antileishmanial drugs. These compounds were found to inhibit the growth of Leishmania parasites, induce cell death mechanisms, and affect mitochondrial function. The study highlights the compounds' effects on parasite membranes, mitochondrial hyperpolarization, and alterations in cellular structures. Additionally, the text explores the role of reactive oxygen species and calcium homeostasis in parasite cell death processes. The Erg-GTr and Erg-GTr2 compounds show promise as chemotherapeutic agents for treating leishmaniasis, with potential for further development and modification. The methods used in the study include chemical synthesis, biological assays, and analysis of cellular responses to the compounds.
