Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) are a group of myeloid cells that accumulate in large numbers in lymphoid tissues of tumor-bearing mice and individuals with infectious diseases, sepsis, trauma, and cancer. They are known for their ability to suppress T-cell responses and are considered a major factor in tumor-associated immune defects. Researchers are seeking to identify specific subsets within MDSC that are responsible for immune suppression and to determine if these subsets differ in their ability to inhibit T-cell responses. Various surface molecules have been suggested to define different immune suppressive myeloid cells, but their specificity for MDSC remains unknown. Identifying specific subsets within MDSC could provide better targets for therapeutic intervention and improve understanding of tumor-induced immune suppression. The study aimed to address conflicting results regarding the phenotype of MDSC in different tumor models by evaluating ten different models of lung, breast, colon cancer, melanoma, and sarcoma in three strains of mice. The researchers conducted a phenotypic and functional analysis of MDSC subsets to identify the subset responsible for immune suppression. The study found that granulocytic MDSC subset showed more profound suppressive activity per cell basis compared to the monocytic subset, particularly at higher MDSC concentrations. However, neither subset was able to inhibit T-cell proliferation induced by anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies. Monocytic MDSC produced higher levels of nitric oxide (NO) compared to granulocytic MDSC, while granulocytic MDSC had higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Both subsets showed increased levels of peroxynitrites, with monocytic MDSC producing more than granulocytic MDSC. Monocytic MDSC were found to induce higher levels of nitrotyrosine (NT) in CD8
