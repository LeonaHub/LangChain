Frozen shoulder, also known as adhesive capsulitis, is a condition characterized by shoulder pain and reduced range of movement. The causes of frozen shoulder are not well understood, but diabetes is a known risk factor. A study conducted genetic analyses using the UK Biobank to identify genetic variants associated with frozen shoulder. Mendelian randomization was used to investigate potential causal relationships between diabetes, obesity, and frozen shoulder. The study found an association between diabetes and frozen shoulder, with type 1 diabetes having the strongest link. The research also identified genetic signals related to frozen shoulder, including a lead SNP on chromosome 22. The study suggests WNT7B as a candidate causal gene for frozen shoulder. Additionally, the study found a significant overlap in genetic signals between frozen shoulder and Dupuytren's disease, with WNT7B being a common factor. Further research is needed to pinpoint the exact causal variant at this locus. The study acknowledges limitations, such as potential misclassification of cases in primary care records and the need for further studies to determine if the findings apply to other ethnic groups.
