HPTN 052 was a Phase III study involving HIV-1 serodiscordant couples that showed ART could prevent HIV-1 transmission, with adherence being crucial for effectiveness. Factors like social support, depression, substance use, and socio-economic factors can impact adherence. The study focused on predictors of adherence in HIV-1 infected individuals offered treatment for prevention, with data from participants randomized to early treatment. Adherence counseling included education, assistance in overcoming obstacles, and regular monitoring. Adherence was assessed through questionnaires, pill counts, and psychosocial data collection. The study found high adherence rates, with reasons for non-adherence including forgetting medication and side effects. Mental health scores were associated with greater adherence, and older age and better social support were linked to higher adherence and viral suppression. The study suggests that mental health may be a key predictor of adherence in stable relationships in resource-limited countries. Limitations included self-report measures and not examining interactions between variables. The study emphasizes the importance of adherence to ART for reducing HIV transmission and suggests strategies for optimizing adherence in clinical settings.
