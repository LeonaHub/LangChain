The text discusses the association between aortic stenosis (AS) and acquired von Willebrand disease (AVWD), focusing on the prevalence of AS in different income countries, the role of Von Willebrand factor (VWF) in hemostasis, and the potential link between AS and VWF deficiency. The review aims to investigate this association through a systematic review of literature published after 2000, using various databases and search strategies following PRISMA 2020 guidelines. The study identified 8 high-quality articles out of 4,684 initially screened, discussing the relationship between aortic valve stenosis and VWF deficiency, particularly in Heyde syndrome. Surgery has been shown to play a significant role in correcting AVWD in Heyde syndrome patients by restoring large VWF multimers. The text also explains how deficiencies in high molecular weight multimers of VWF can lead to hemostasis impairment, emphasizing the importance of understanding and managing this condition. Studies suggest that VWF deficiency in AS patients can increase bleeding risks, which can be reversed through surgery, with valve replacement improving VWF activity. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and develop strategies to address associated complications beyond anemia.
