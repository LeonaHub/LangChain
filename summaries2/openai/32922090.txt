Preterm birth is a significant concern in twin pregnancies, with a higher incidence compared to singleton pregnancies. Identifying twin pregnancies at risk of preterm birth, especially those with a history of prior preterm birth, is crucial. Screening for a short cervix using transvaginal ultrasound between 16-24 weeks of gestation can help predict preterm delivery risk. Cervical softness, influenced by factors like collagen content and tissue properties, may play a role in assessing preterm birth risk in twin pregnancies. Ultrasound elastography, specifically shear wave elastography (SWE), is a promising tool for evaluating tissue elasticity. SWE, which measures tissue stiffness quantitatively, has shown effectiveness in assessing cervical softness in both singleton and twin pregnancies. A study conducted at Ramathibodi Hospital in Thailand compared cervical stiffness between singleton and twin pregnancies using SWE. The study found differences in cervical softness between twin and singleton pregnancies, particularly at the lower point of the cervix. While SWE shows promise for tissue evaluation, further research is needed to fully understand its potential for preterm surveillance in twin pregnancies.
