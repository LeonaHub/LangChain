The text discusses the out-of-home food sector (OHFS) in the UK, focusing on the prevalence of energy-dense food consumption, underestimation of calorie content, and its link to poor diet quality and obesity. It mentions the implementation of mandatory calorie labeling laws in response to these issues, particularly in England, where regulations require large food businesses to display calorie content. Studies have been conducted to assess the effectiveness of these regulations, customer behavior, and socio-demographic factors influencing purchasing habits. Findings show low compliance with calorie labeling, high calorie purchases exceeding recommendations, and limited awareness and use of labeling by customers. The text suggests that future research should explore the impact of mandatory calorie labeling on consumer behavior and menu reformulation in the OHFS to address overconsumption and improve public health.
