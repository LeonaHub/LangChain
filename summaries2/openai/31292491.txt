Ependymoma (EPN) is a malignant brain tumor that primarily affects children, commonly found in the posterior fossa. Traditional classification based on histological grades may not accurately predict prognosis due to factors like age, tumor location, and genetic alterations. Recent research has identified genetic heterogeneity within EPN tumors, impacting behavior and prognosis. Current standard therapy involves surgery followed by radiation, but effective treatments are limited due to location and resistance. Amblyomin-X, a protein from tick salivary glands, shows promise as a new therapeutic option for pediatric anaplastic EPN. Studies demonstrate its anticoagulant, antiangiogenic, and antitumor properties, inducing apoptosis in EPN cells while sparing normal cells. Amblyomin-X treatment results in cell death in EPNs without affecting normal cells, making it a potentially selective treatment. It shows superior effects on EPN cells compared to temozolomide or cisplatin, inducing apoptosis selectively. Preclinical evidence supports its effectiveness in vivo, particularly in xenograft models. Further molecular studies are suggested for better understanding and treatment of EPNs. The text also discusses the pathologic anatomy, molecular diagnostics, and classification of EPNs based on DNA methylation profiles. Studies involving Amblyomin-X treatment on EPN xenograft models show significant tumor regression, confirmed through imaging techniques and histological analysis. The methodology includes MRI analysis, in vivo imaging, and histological procedures.
