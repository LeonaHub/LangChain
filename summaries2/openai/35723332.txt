Pecans are a significant crop in the southeastern United States, particularly in Georgia, where pecan scab caused by the fungus Venturia effusa is a major concern for growers due to its impact on yield. While planting resistant cultivars is the most effective control method, the pathogen has adapted to historically resistant cultivars, leading to the widespread use of demethylation-inhibiting (DMI) fungicides for scab management. However, over-reliance on DMIs has resulted in reports of fungal resistance since their introduction in the 1970s. Resistance mechanisms include amino acid changes in the CYP51 gene, overexpression of the gene, and efflux pumps reducing fungicide accumulation. Studies have identified mutations and increased gene expression of CYP51A and CYP51B as potential mechanisms of resistance in V. effusa. Field experiments have shown variability in scab pressure and varying levels of control with DMI fungicides. Newer DMI fungicides like mefentrifluconazole and difenoconazole are more effective against scab, with limited cross-resistance. Understanding resistance mechanisms can aid in developing rapid detection methods to track resistance traits in orchard populations. Field sensitivity evaluations and in vitro assays have been conducted to test the effectiveness of different fungicide treatments and understand resistance mechanisms in V. effusa isolates. Studies have involved DNA extraction, sequencing of CYP51A and CYP51B genes, and gene expression analysis to identify mutations and overexpression as potential causes of resistance. The research emphasizes the importance of careful and strategic fungicide application to
