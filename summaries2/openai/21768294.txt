Large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia is a clonal disease originating from mature T cells or NK cells, functioning as cytotoxic lymphocytes. The 2008 World Health classification distinguishes T-cell LGL leukemia from aggressive NK-cell leukemia and chronic NK-cell leukemia. Aggressive NK-cell leukemia is a fatal illness with no effective therapies, while chronic NK-cell leukemia displays a CD3âˆ’CD56+ immunophenotype. FTY720, an immunomodulatory drug approved for multiple sclerosis, has shown antitumor activity at high dosages by inducing apoptosis of leukemic cells. This study reports the biologic activity of FTY720 in chronic and aggressive NK-cell leukemia, inducing apoptosis of leukemic NK cells through Mcl-1 degradation via a lysosomal pathway. Lipidomic experiments showed increased levels of proapoptosis sphingosine in leukemic cells after FTY720 treatment. Using a rat NK-cell leukemia model, the study demonstrated that FTY720 induced complete remission of aggressive NK-cell leukemia. The study involved patients with NK-cell leukemia and healthy donors, with a focus on apoptosis and cell viability. Various techniques such as Western blotting, lentiviral shRNA transfection, and cytosolic extraction were used to investigate the impact of FTY720 on cell viability and cellular processes in NK cells.
