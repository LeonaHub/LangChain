Exposure to ethanol during pregnancy can lead to preventable birth defects and long-term deficits in physical and cognitive development, particularly affecting the vulnerable brain growth spurt. Histone and epigenetic alterations, including histone methylation, play a role in ethanol-induced developmental neurotoxicity. G9a and GLP, histone methyltransferases, are crucial for neuronal functions during early brain development. Studies on P7 mice have shown that low doses of ethanol can induce mild neurodegeneration by activating G9a through specific histone modifications. Pharmacological inhibition of G9a activity has been found to prevent histone modifications and rescue neurodegeneration in neonatal mice. The research also suggests a potential protective role of G9a inhibition against ethanol-induced neurodegeneration. Further studies are needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying these effects and to explore potential therapeutic interventions for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder.
