The text discusses the importance of suitable animal models, specifically the Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat, for studying diabetic nephropathy and developing treatments for renal complications. Previous studies have noted limitations in observing progressive morphological changes in GK rats, but a new study aimed to examine the long-term effects of hyperglycemia and aging on renal lesions in these rats. The experiments conducted on male GK rats and age-matched male Wistar rats involved analyzing urine and blood samples, evaluating kidney morphology, and assessing immunohistochemical markers. Results showed that prolonged hyperglycemia in GK rats led to morphological changes in their kidneys, including glomerulosclerosis, mesangial cell proliferation, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis, similar to human diabetic nephropathy. The study also found increased expression of markers of extracellular matrix formation and macrophage infiltration in the kidneys of GK rats. Despite observing functional and morphological changes, parameters like creatinine clearance and BUN did not worsen compared to control Wistar rats, suggesting that additional factors like hyperlipidemia and hypertension may exacerbate renal failure in diabetic nephropathy. The study indicated that prolonged hyperglycemia may significantly contribute to inducing progressive diabetic nephropathy in human type 2 diabetes, with aging and obesity potentially worsening renal injury.
