Glaucoma is a complex optic neuropathy associated with visual field loss and optic nerve degeneration, often due to increased intraocular pressure. It is classified into primary congenital glaucoma, primary open-angle glaucoma, and primary angle-closure glaucoma. While genetic studies have identified LTBP2 as a causative gene for primary congenital glaucoma, a definitive genetic cause for primary angle closure glaucoma in humans has not been established. Research suggests that mutations in LTBP2 may contribute to various forms of glaucoma by affecting the extracellular matrix and TGF-Î² functions. A study involving patients with primary angle-closure glaucoma and pseudoexfoliation syndrome identified potential disease-causing variations in the LTBP2 gene, specifically the mutations p. Gln1417Arg and p. Gly1660Trp. These mutations were considered potential contributors to primary angle-closure glaucoma due to their characteristics and absence in control screenings. Further research is recommended to explore the role of LTBP2 mutations in larger samples of primary angle-closure glaucoma patients.
