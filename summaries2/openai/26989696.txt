Diabetes mellitus is a global health concern with a rising number of affected individuals facing an increased risk of heart failure and cardiovascular complications, including diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). Research indicates that chronic hyperglycemia and oxidative stress trigger cardiomyocyte apoptosis, a key factor in DCM development. Studies have explored curcumin, an antioxidant derived from turmeric, as a potential therapeutic agent for DCM due to its protective effects against cardiac damage induced by high glucose. Experimental studies have shown that curcumin treatment can increase cell viability, reduce apoptosis, regulate apoptotic-related proteins, and decrease oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes exposed to high glucose. Curcumin's effects on the Akt/GSK-3Î² signaling pathway suggest its potential in inhibiting apoptosis and protecting against DCM. The study emphasizes the importance of reducing cardiomyocyte apoptosis and oxidative stress as a therapeutic strategy for DCM, highlighting curcumin's potential as a cardioprotective treatment.
