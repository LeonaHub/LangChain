Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis (IPH) is a rare disorder in children characterized by hemoptysis, iron deficiency anemia, and pulmonary infiltrates. The incidence and prevalence of IPH are not well-known, but it can be fatal, with a mortality rate of up to 50%. Children with IPH tend to have a worse prognosis than adults, historically surviving an average of 2.5 years post-diagnosis, but currently, 86% may survive beyond 5 years. A study investigated the clinical characteristics and prognosis of IPH in children through a retrospective review of cases at a specific hospital. The study found that IPH was diagnosed in 107 children over a 21-year period, with various clinical manifestations such as cough, hemoptysis, fever, and dyspnea. Anemia was the most common initial symptom, with laboratory tests showing microcytic hypochromic anemia in a majority of patients. Treatment typically involves glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive agents, with good response seen in most patients. Recurrence of pulmonary hemorrhage can be a challenge during treatment, but low-dose oral prednisone was associated with prolonged survival and decreased recurrence rates. Early recognition and proper treatment are crucial for improving prognosis in IPH.
