The text discusses the heterogeneity of the 7 chain of human plasma fibrinogen, focusing on the molecular weight and amino acid sequence variations at the C-terminus. It identifies three forms of the γ chain and describes the differential splicing event in RNA sequences encoding the platelet recognition site. The study investigates the functional importance of the C-terminal end of the γ chain in fibrin formation and platelet aggregation, particularly with fibrinogen γ57.5. Various experiments were conducted to analyze the effects of synthetic peptides and antibodies on fibrinogen binding, platelet aggregation, and dissociation. The study also explores the role of fibrinogen in hemostasis, alternative RNA splicing effects on platelet recognition sites, and the interaction of RGD sequences in fibrinogen with platelet membrane receptors. Specific residues within the γ57.5 chain that are involved in platelet-fibrinogen interactions were identified, with the L2B epitope determined to include residues R-409-PEH-412. The text also discusses the secondary structures of γ57.5 and γ50 chains, MoAb L2B binding properties, and the presence of γ57.5 epitopes in fibrinogen, particularly in crosslinked and non-crosslinked fibrin. The proposed structure of a crosslinked fibrin γ chain dimer is described, suggesting the exposure of the C-terminal residues of the γ57.5 chain in fibrin clots, which may play a role in fibrin-mediated hemostatic events.
