The text discusses the magneto-strain effect in CrGeTe3, a 2D ferromagnetic van der Waals material with unique properties suitable for various applications. The magneto-strain effect is associated with changes in physical dimensions due to magnetic ordering, impacting the material's electronic and magnetic properties. Experimental studies, including ARPES experiments, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, have been conducted to analyze the magneto-strain effects in CrGeTe3. The material exhibits ferromagnetic ordering with an out-of-plane easy axis of magnetization and a renormalized electronic structure, leading to 2D ferromagnetism. The text highlights the interplay between effective electron-electron correlation and spin-orbit coupling in CrGeTe3, influencing its magnetic behavior. The study suggests that CrGeTe3 could be a promising candidate for strain engineering and spintronic applications due to its tunable properties. The magneto-strain effects in CrGeTe3 are characterized by band shifts, broadening, and twinned bands, influenced by lattice contractions and interactions between different atoms. The text also discusses the electronic band structure of CrGeTe3 at different temperatures, emphasizing the role of localized and itinerant states in magneto-strain effects. Overall, the text provides a comprehensive overview of the magneto-strain effects in CrGeTe3 and its potential applications in spintronics and straintronics.
