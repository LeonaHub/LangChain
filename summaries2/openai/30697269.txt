Pre-eclampsia is a serious pregnancy condition with risk factors like age, hypertension, and obesity. Understanding its mechanisms is crucial, with vascular remodeling failure and trophoblast invasion playing key roles. The Notch signaling pathway and microRNAs like miR-210 are important in trophoblast invasion. A study using JAR cells explored miR-210's role in hypoxia response, showing it promotes cell behavior changes and targets PTPN2. PTPN2 suppression by miR-210 may contribute to pre-eclampsia development through the PDGFR-Akt pathway. Further research is needed to fully understand this mechanism and explore miR-210 and PTPN2 as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for pre-eclampsia.
