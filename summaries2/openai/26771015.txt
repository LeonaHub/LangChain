Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has shown positive effects on cortical organization, alertness, and recovery of motor and cognitive functions in animal models of traumatic brain injury. VNS is used to treat various disorders like epilepsy, depression, and chronic pain, with safety data supporting its use in cervical VNS with implanted electrodes. VNS has emerged as a potential treatment for tinnitus, with studies showing promising results when paired with specific tones. However, surgical implantation of electrodes for VNS in humans is challenging due to invasiveness and high costs. Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation (tVNS) is being explored as an alternative treatment for conditions like chronic tinnitus. A study on tVNS paired with notched music therapy for chronic tinnitus found significant improvements in tinnitus loudness and awareness. The treatment was safe, with no specific side effects reported. The study suggests that tVNS paired with notched music may be effective in improving subjective tinnitus symptoms in some patients, although further research is needed to confirm its long-term efficacy.
