Haldane's Rule states that in hybrid offspring of different animal races, the absent, rare, or sterile sex is always the heterozygous sex, with females often experiencing greater fitness reductions. The rule's mechanisms are debated, with explanations including the "Large X-effect" in Drosophila and the Faster Z-effect in birds, where Z-chromosome genes evolve faster due to factors like genetic drift and selection. Studies on introgression rates in avian species support Haldane's Rule, with Z-linked loci showing lower introgression rates compared to autosomal loci. Various methods, such as coalescent modeling and cline analyses, are used to estimate introgression rates, with Nm calculations and whole genome sequencing data also employed. While most avian studies support dominance theory as an explanation for Haldane's Rule, exceptions exist, such as higher introgression rates for mitochondrial loci in certain hybrid populations. The text emphasizes the importance of considering factors like mate choice and selection pressures when interpreting introgression patterns and highlights the need for evidence of reduced hybrid fitness to confidently invoke Haldane's Rule. Future research could explore introgression rates in specific genomic regions to gain insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying the rule.
