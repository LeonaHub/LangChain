Mitochondrial dysfunction and increased free radical formation, particularly through nitric oxide (NO), are associated with neuronal cell death in Parkinson's disease. Inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase have shown promise in reducing toxicity in animal models. Indole β-carbolines, such as harmalol and harmine, exhibit neuroprotective effects against cytotoxicity in dopaminergic neurons. These compounds inhibit oxidative toxicity, lipid peroxidation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Studies on PC12 cells indicate that β-carbolines and R-(-)-deprenyl can reduce cell death by preserving mitochondrial function and inhibiting caspase-3 activation. β-carbolines defend against nitrogen species toxicity, while R-(-)-deprenyl inhibits ROS formation and restores GSH levels. Further research is needed to explore the potential clinical applications of these compounds in treating Parkinson's disease.
