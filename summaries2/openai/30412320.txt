The text discusses a study conducted on crown preparations in dentistry, focusing on factors contributing to crown remakes, such as marginal misfit and esthetic failures. The research aimed to investigate clinical remake rates for crowns among dentists in the National Dental Practice-Based Research Network. The study involved data collection through questionnaires and a prospective cohort study on crown acceptability. Dentists underwent training and enrolled eligible patients, with data forms and results available on the network's website. The study evaluated patient and practice characteristics in relation to crown acceptance and fit, with statistical analysis conducted to adjust for clustering. The study found a 3.8% crown rejection rate, with proximal misfit and suspected laboratory errors being common reasons for rejection. Factors like dentist experience, practice busyness, and patient demographics influenced crown fit. The study had limitations, such as subjective outcome measures and potential bias, but provided valuable insights into factors affecting crown success.
