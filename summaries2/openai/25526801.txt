The text discusses the use of a thrombin inhibitor derived from leeches, known as hirudin, in blood research due to its ability to block clot formation. A recombinant version of hirudin, RGD-hirudin, has been developed and studied extensively for its interaction with thrombin. The study involved molecular simulations, protein modeling, and docking simulations to analyze the interaction between RGD-hirudin and thrombin. Mutant variants of RGD-hirudin were also tested for their thrombin inhibition and anti-platelet aggregation activities. The study focused on identifying key residues in RGD-hirudin essential for its interaction with thrombin, with results indicating the importance of specific residues for binding affinity. The text also highlights the potential of RGD-hirudin as a more effective anti-coagulant and anti-thrombotic agent compared to wild-type hirudin, with implications for developing new oral drugs to combat thrombotic diseases.
