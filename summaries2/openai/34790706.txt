Regular high-intensity aerobic exercise can lead to beneficial structural changes in the heart known as "athlete's heart," improving cardiac output and sports performance. However, prolonged intense exercise may result in adverse cardiac remodeling, fibrosis, and an increased risk of atrial fibrillation. Soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) is a potential biomarker for fibrosis and cardiac remodeling due to physical exercise, impacting cardiac blood flow regulation. Elevated sVCAM-1 levels have been associated with inflammation and endothelial dysfunction in the heart, potentially contributing to adverse cardiac effects from intense exercise. A study investigated the association between sVCAM-1 levels and cardiac structural changes in long-distance runners before and after a marathon race, as well as its potential role as a biomarker for atrial remodeling and atrial fibrillation in high-performance athletes. The study found significant differences in structural changes and sVCAM-1 plasma levels between high-intensity, low-intensity, and control groups. sVCAM-1 levels and peak aerobic capacity were significant predictors of left atrial remodeling in athletes. Highly trained runners had elevated sVCAM-1 levels compared to less trained individuals, particularly after intense exercise like a marathon. The text also discusses the impact of different types of exercise on sVCAM-1 levels, highlighting the need for further research to explore the relationship between sVCAM-1 levels, exercise intensity, and cardiac chamber remodeling in athletes. High-intensity physical exercise in male runners is linked to increased sVCAM-1 plasma levels, positively correlated with higher left atrial volume, suggesting sVCAM-1 as a potential biomarker for assessing adverse effects on left atrial structure and function in high-performance athletes, potentially predicting the risk of atrial fibrillation.
