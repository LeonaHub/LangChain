The text discusses the origins and transmission of beta-coronaviruses, focusing on recent outbreaks like SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, with bats as progenitors and intermediate hosts like palm civets and dromedary camels. It mentions natural infections in various animal species, the importance of identifying reservoir and intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2, and experimental infections in different animals. The entry process of SARS-CoV-2 involving the spike protein and ACE2 receptor availability in different species is detailed. The study examines ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL mRNA expression in animal respiratory tracts, using primary cell cultures to assess species susceptibility to the virus. It highlights differences in viral replication among species and cellular changes in infected cell cultures. The text also discusses the susceptibility of dogs, hamsters, ferrets, and ungulates to SARS-CoV-2, with findings on ACE2 expression levels and potential cellular receptors for viral entry. Additionally, it covers the distribution and replication of SARS-CoV-2 in experimentally infected ferrets and ungulates, noting limitations in detecting virus-related effects in cell culture models. Challenges in using primary cell culture models for studying SARS-CoV-2 infection and efforts to identify host species of the virus are also addressed.
