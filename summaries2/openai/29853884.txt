Adiponectin, traditionally known for its role in energy storage, was discovered in the late 1980s to have endocrine functions, impacting various tissues beyond white adipose tissue. It plays a crucial role in regulating reproductive functions, with receptors identified in reproductive organs. Adiponectin levels vary in humans, rats, and pigs, influencing metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and reproductive processes. The hormone acts through receptors like AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, present in tissues involved in reproduction. Adiponectin affects gene expression in the pituitary and ovaries, influencing hormone secretion and ovarian functions. In conditions like PCOS, adiponectin levels are altered, impacting androgen production and reproductive health. Adiponectin also plays a role in early pregnancy, implantation, and uterine receptivity, affecting steroidogenesis and prostaglandin synthesis. The hormone influences maternal-fetal interactions, promoting embryo development and regulating trophoblast cell functions in the placenta. Adiponectin's actions in
