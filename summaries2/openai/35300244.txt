Aortic intramural hematomas (AIH) are thrombosed aortic dissections that primarily affect older females with cardiovascular risk factors, often involving the descending aorta. Diagnosis is typically done through computed tomography (CT) scans, with MRI techniques considered a secondary diagnostic tool. Treatment options include medical therapy for stable patients or thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) for those with complications. TEVAR aims to exclude and favor thrombosis of the false lumen, with potential complications including graft-related issues, stroke, and aortic dissection. The text discusses a case of a 58-year-old female with AIH type B who underwent TEVAR and subsequent open surgery with aortic graft replacements due to complications. The text also outlines the management of AIH, including the use of medications and surgical interventions based on specific indications. The Bolton Relay procedure, a type of endovascular repair for aortic aneurysms, is described, along with potential complications. The importance of careful consideration before opting for surgical intervention like TEVAR is emphasized, with close monitoring and follow-up through CT scans recommended due to the risks of complications like aortic dissection. The text also mentions the significance of recognizing symptoms and risk factors for AIH and highlights the need for a thorough evaluation of the potential risks and benefits before considering preemptive treatment with TEVAR.
