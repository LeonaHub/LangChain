The text discusses the synthesis and characterization of oligosaccharide-based block copolymers (BCPs) through copper(I)-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) click chemistry. It emphasizes the importance of supramolecular interactions in enhancing self-assembly, particularly in achieving specific morphologies and functions in BCPs. The study focuses on the formation of ionic nanochannels and the impact of counterions on BCP self-assembly behavior. Techniques like shearing, external fields, and templating are used to control BCP orientation, with a focus on perpendicular lamella nanostructure formation. The research highlights the role of T+/counteranionâ€“ junctions in fine-tuning block copolymer self-assembly and achieving long-range ordered structures, showcasing potential applications in advanced nanopatterning and electrochemical energy storage.
