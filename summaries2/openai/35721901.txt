The text discusses the significance of polynuclear coordination compounds with octahedral building blocks in solid-state inorganic chemistry, particularly focusing on luminescent characteristics displayed by the [M6X8L6]2– clusters. Recent applications of these clusters include their potential use in tracking cancer cells and as bioimaging agents. The study describes the synthesis and characterization of a molybdenum cluster, (H3O)2[Mo6(μ3-Cl)8Cl6]·6H2O, and its ability to detect nitroaromatic compounds, specifically TNT, through fluorescence emission. The text details experimental procedures, analytical techniques used for characterization, and computational calculations to study the electronic structure and optical properties of the molybdenum clusters. The study suggests that the molybdenum clusters can effectively detect TNT at low concentrations, with promising results indicating their potential for detecting nitroaromatic explosives. The text also discusses the quenching process of fluorescence by nitroaromatic compounds, the formation of ground-state complexes, and the role of TNT ligands in excited states impacting luminescence. Future research on sensor selectivity is recommended for practical applications of these luminescent clusters in detecting explosives.
