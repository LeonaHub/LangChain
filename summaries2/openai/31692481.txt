Gliomas are primary brain tumors classified by malignancy, with high-grade gliomas being incurable and impacting patients' quality of life. Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) measures are crucial in survivorship care for high-grade glioma patients, assessing treatment effects on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Challenges in using PROs include methodological quality, missing data, and caregiver proxies. Specific tools like EORTC QLQ-C30 and MDASI-BT are used for symptom assessment in brain tumor patients. Integrating PROs into clinical practice faces challenges but can improve patient-provider communication and symptom management. The importance of using multiple outcomes in neuro-oncology, including PRO measures, is emphasized. The text also discusses the benefits of involving caregivers in PRO assessments and the potential of new technical solutions for remote data collection.
