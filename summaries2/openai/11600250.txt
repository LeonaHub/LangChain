Cytokines, particularly Interleukin-6 (IL-6), are crucial in immune and inflammatory responses. Acute phase proteins, like C-reactive protein and α1 antitrypsin, play roles in inflammation and tissue protection. A study on burn patients investigated the effects of a Trypsin-Chymotrypsin enzyme preparation on acute inflammatory responses, focusing on IL-1β and IL-6 levels. The study found that the enzyme reduced cytokine levels, accelerated wound healing, and improved scar outcomes. Patients treated with the preparation showed quicker wound epithelialization. The study emphasized the importance of examining anti-inflammatory cytokines during treatment to understand burn injury pathophysiology better. The research was supported by ELDER Pharmaceutical.
