A study conducted at a tertiary referral center in Australia focused on identifying high-risk patients for readmission within 60 days of discharge after ileostomy formation, particularly looking at renal function. The study analyzed data from 171 patients who underwent ileostomy procedures between 2015 and 2020, finding that dehydration and acute kidney injury were common reasons for readmission. Factors such as serum sodium levels, creatinine levels, and estimated glomerular filtration rate were assessed, with findings indicating a decline in renal function post-ileostomy formation. The study also highlighted the impact of factors like ileostomy reversal, anastomotic leak, and colorectal surgeries on patient outcomes. The text emphasizes the importance of preserving renal function in patients with ileostomies and suggests further research on hydration strategies for this patient population.
