The text explores the Complexity Account of Treatment Efficacy in treating lexical semantic deficits in individuals with aphasia, focusing on semantic complexity within semantic categories. It discusses the relevance of typicality hierarchies, presenting experimental studies on treatment effects moving from complex to simple category items. The text reviews theoretical frameworks on semantic categories, discussing living and nonliving category distinctions based on semantic features. It explains how typical examples within categories possess more prototypical features, while atypical examples are considered more complex due to a wider range of features. The text also delves into the impact of semantic complexity on treatment outcomes, emphasizing the importance of reinforcing semantic attributes for generalization to untrained items. Studies on naming deficits in aphasia highlight the effects of training on typical and atypical examples within categories, with improvements observed in language processing and production skills. The text discusses the influence of atypical and typical examples on semantic and phonological representations in individuals with aphasia, emphasizing the importance of considering semantic complexity hierarchy in treatment approaches. It also mentions the clinical relevance of generalization to naming untrained items in treatment studies for conditions like aphasia. Further research is suggested to explore complexity in the semantic domain and its impact on language recovery patterns in individuals with aphasia.
