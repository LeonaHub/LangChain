Comparative genome sequencing reveals that closely related organisms have similar total gene numbers, but differences exist in gene identity due to gains and losses during evolution. Gene duplication and loss play crucial roles in evolution, with recent attention on gene loss. Challenges in studying gene gain and loss include data collection and analysis, with methods developed to study these processes accurately at a genome-wide level. Tree reconciliation methods in evolutionary biology can lead to biases, overestimating duplicates near the root and losses across the tree. This bias affects inferences about vertebrate genome evolution, but careful analysis can still yield valid conclusions. The text discusses biases in inferring gene trees in whole genome studies, such as low bootstrap support, computational limitations, and phylogenetic methods impacting accuracy. Biases in tree reconciliation can result from errors in tree topologies, leading to incorrect inferences about duplications and losses. The text suggests iterative approaches to account for biases in non-informative branches and highlights discrepancies in estimating gene losses between methods. The study by Blomme et al. on gene gain and loss in vertebrates is mentioned, noting biases in tree reconciliation methods and potential artifactual patterns. The text emphasizes the impact of incomplete lineage-sorting on gene duplication placement and recommends caution in inferring whole-genome duplication
