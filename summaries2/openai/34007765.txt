Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a significant concern among older adults due to its high prevalence globally. Fragility fractures, such as hip, vertebral, and non-vertebral fractures, are also a major issue, particularly affecting older adults. Studies suggest that individuals with T2DM are more vulnerable to fragility fractures, especially in elderly patients over 60 years old. A systematic review was conducted to assess the correlation between T2DM and fragility fractures in this population, with most studies supporting a link between T2DM and increased fracture risk. Factors contributing to bone fragility in T2DM include hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines, and hormonal imbalances. While T2DM patients may have higher bone mineral density (BMD), they are still at an increased risk of fractures due to impaired bone quality. Various diagnostic tools can help assess bone health in T2DM patients, and specific fracture risk factors such as diabetes duration and medication use should be considered. Pharmacological treatments for T2DM can have varying effects on bone health, with some increasing fracture risk. Clinicians treating elderly T2DM patients should be aware of their increased vulnerability to fragility fractures and consider appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
