The text discusses the hierarchical composition of tooth dentin, its anisotropic properties, and how mechanical properties are influenced by structure, composition, and environment. It compares the reference point indentation (RPI) technique to traditional methods for evaluating dentin microhardness. The study used micro-Raman spectroscopy to analyze dentin composition and crystallinity, comparing superficial and deep dentin. Results showed higher microhardness in superficial dentin, with differences in chemical composition and crystallinity. The BioDent RPI technique provided consistent results and showed a positive relationship between mineral content and dentin hardness. The study also evaluated the relationship between dentin crystallinity, carbonate content, and hardness, finding variations between superficial and deep dentin layers. Overall, the study suggests that as carbonate content increases, dentin crystallinity decreases, affecting its mechanical properties.
