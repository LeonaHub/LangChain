The text discusses the integration of quantum dots (QDs) into biomolecules for biomedical applications, highlighting the advantages and concerns associated with their use. While QDs offer benefits like high quantum yield and narrow emission spectrum, toxicity concerns, particularly with heavy metal-based QDs, have been raised. Studies have shown that heavy metal-based QDs can induce harmful effects such as altering cell growth and DNA damage. In response, eco-friendly QDs like indium phosphide (InP) QDs have been developed, offering low toxicity and tunable photoluminescence. However, some studies suggest that InP QDs may still exhibit toxicity, with varying degrees depending on surface modifications. The text details a study on the renal toxicity of InP/ZnS QDs in mice, showing that different surface modifications can impact renal function and inflammatory responses. The study also explores the effects of QDs on oxidative stress and apoptosis pathways in kidney tissues. Results indicate that QDs can cause renal injury through oxidative stress and inflammatory responses, with different surface modifications leading to varying degrees of damage. The study emphasizes the importance of monitoring potential toxicity and stress reactions when introducing exogenous substances like QDs. Additionally, the text discusses the effects of In-based QDs on kidney tissues, highlighting their accumulation in the kidneys over time without causing significant histological changes. The study also delves into the impact of QDs on biochemical parameters related to kidney function, inflammatory responses, and oxidative stress. Overall, the text underscores the importance of understanding the toxicity mechanisms of Q
