Influenza viruses are a significant global health concern, causing numerous deaths annually, especially among the elderly. In the United States, seasonal influenza poses an economic burden and strains healthcare resources, potentially leading to workforce reductions and shortages of medical supplies during peak seasons. Rapid and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and prevention. Strategies like patient isolation, vaccination, and respiratory illness screening help mitigate influenza outbreaks. Predicting surges can aid healthcare facilities in preparing by allocating resources, stockpiling medications, and adjusting staffing levels. A study in Los Angeles utilized Virena software to transmit real-time influenza test results, focusing on outpatient clinics and emergency departments. The research aimed to predict influenza activity in emergency departments based on community testing data. The study found that a steep increase in outpatient cases preceded a rise in emergency department cases by 1-3 weeks, serving as an early warning sign. The Sofia influenza A+B FIA test was used for tracking influenza activity in a large geographic area, providing user-friendly and specific results. The study compared influenza cases in outpatient clinics to those in emergency departments, offering an early warning system for increased influenza activity. Limitations include the study's geographic specificity and the need for further evaluation as more clinics are included. Virena software was used for deidentifying influenza test results, allowing real-time tracking in the Los Angeles area. Expanding the software to include other respiratory viruses like RSV could provide valuable information for hospital systems and clinics. Overall, utilizing outpatient influenza data is crucial for monitoring and predicting influenza activity in
