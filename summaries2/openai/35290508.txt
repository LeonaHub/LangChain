Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) plays a crucial role in diagnosing prostate cancer by identifying suspicious lesions and staging the disease accurately. Correct staging is essential for treatment decisions, with curative treatment being more likely in cases without extra prostatic extension. Various studies have examined the accuracy of mpMRI in local staging, with recent research focusing on developing imaging-based scores to assess extraprostatic extension. One study aimed to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of specific mpMRI features in predicting extraprostatic extension and develop a comprehensive scoring system for this purpose. The study involved patients with prostate cancer who underwent pre-operative mpMRI examinations and followed ethical guidelines. The study utilized a specific mpMRI protocol and involved histopathological examinations by experienced pathologists. Imaging analysis was conducted by radiologists using a medical imaging workstation, and statistical analysis included various tests to evaluate the performance of scoring approaches. The study developed a grading system called mEPE-score based on specific features observed in mpMRI imaging for prostate cancer, showing promising results with an AUC of 0.84. The mEPE-score was compared to other scoring systems and found to have comparable or superior results. Internal and external validation of the mEPE-score showed good diagnostic performance in predicting extraprostatic extension. Another study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of various features in predicting extraprostatic extension in prostate cancer using the PI-RADS v2.1 system, highlighting the importance of a standardized definition of measurable extraprostatic disease. The text also discusses different scoring systems used in assessing the likelihood of extraprostatic extension in prostate cancer based on MRI findings, emphasizing the importance of using an MRI-derived EPE-score for consistent and reliable assessment. The study concludes that using a combined score allows for a more reliable evaluation of prostate extracapsular extension compared to individual features.
