The text discusses inflammatory periradicular lesions (IPLs) in the root canal system, such as periapical granulomas (PG) and periapical cysts (PC), which are common inflammatory conditions associated with necrotic teeth. The progression from PGs to PCs involves factors like growth factors, immune regulation, and anti-apoptotic proteins. A study aimed to evaluate the expression of these factors in PGs and PCs to better understand their role in IPL development. The study analyzed clinical, demographic, radiographic, histological, and immunohistochemical data of 52 individuals with IPLs, finding no significant differences in factors like chronic inflammatory infiltrates, epithelial lining thickness, and cellular proliferation index among the groups. The study also examined the expression of CD57+ cells, Bcl-2, EGF, KGF, and EGFR in IPLs, with varying frequencies among PGs and PCs. EGF and KGF were more common in PCs than in PGs, with EGF-positive cells more frequent in symptomatic cases. CD57+ cells were associated with moderate/intense inflammatory infiltrates. The study concluded that factors like KGF and EGF may influence the development of IPLs, with KGF potentially playing a crucial role in the early stages of PC development.
