The text discusses the Abyssinian pea, a distinct taxon cultivated in Ethiopia and Yemen with uncertain origins. It shares traits with domesticated peas but has unique characteristics, limited genetic diversity, and faces reproductive barriers. Genetic studies suggest it may have resulted from hybridization between Pisum sativum and Pisum fulvum around 4000 years ago. The study aims to distinguish hypotheses by comparing DNA sequences of different pea species and subspecies. It explores genetic diversity, hybridization events, and relationships within the Pisum genus, focusing on the Abyssinian pea's divergence and potential contributions to pea improvement. The text also delves into the genetic basis of seed dormancy and pod dehiscence in Pisum, highlighting the importance of specific genes in domestication. It discusses the genetic relationships between different subspecies of Pisum, emphasizing the unique alleles and ancient divergence of the Abyssinian pea. The study suggests a close relationship between P. s. ssp. abyssinicum and P. s. ssp. elatius, challenging the independent domestication of the Abyssinian pea and indicating strong selection and isolation as driving factors in its evolution.
