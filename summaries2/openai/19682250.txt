The text discusses the role of capping protein (CP) in regulating actin dynamics in eukaryotic cells, particularly in processes like cell motility and cytokinesis. CP controls actin filament assembly, essential for actin-based motility, and is crucial for regulating actin filament length and organization. The significance of CP is highlighted in diseases like malaria caused by Plasmodium, emphasizing the importance of understanding CP's role in combating infectious diseases. The text delves into the complex life cycle of the malaria parasite, focusing on the specialized stages involved in invasion of host cells and the importance of CP in various parasite life cycle stages. Studies on Plasmodium CPβ show its role in sporozoite gliding motility and transmission to mosquito salivary glands, emphasizing its importance in parasite motility and transmission. The text also discusses experiments involving the disruption of the CPβ gene in parasites, revealing its role in mosquito midgut invasion and sporozoite maturation. CPβ was found to be essential for sporozoite gliding locomotion and transmission to mammalian hosts but dispensable for asexual erythrocytic parasite growth. The study suggests that CP plays a role in stabilizing F-actin and facilitating fast locomotion in Plasmodium sporozoites. Experimental procedures involving parasite transfection, genotypic analysis,
