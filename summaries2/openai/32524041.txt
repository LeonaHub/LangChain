The text discusses the use of neurostimulation devices like vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS), and brain-responsive neurostimulation (RNS System) as adjunctive treatments for drug-resistant epilepsy. It focuses on potential unintended adverse effects of neurostimulation on sleep, particularly with the RNS System, which can reduce seizure frequency by desynchronizing high-frequency cortical rhythms. The impact of this desynchronization on sleep, dominated by slower, synchronized frequencies, is unknown. Studies have been conducted to investigate the effects of brain-responsive neurostimulation on sleep disruption, with polysomnography used to monitor sleep patterns and analyze the relationship between neurostimulation and arousals during sleep. Results suggest that brain-responsive neurostimulation does not significantly disrupt sleep, and arousals may precede stimulations in some cases. The text also mentions the need for larger studies to understand the impact of neurostimulation on sleep physiology and suggests that studying patients with thalamic RNS System leads could provide insights into the effects of different stimulation targets and timing on sleep.
