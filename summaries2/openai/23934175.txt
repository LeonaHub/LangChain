The text discusses the classification and genetic profiles of infiltrating/diffuse gliomas, emphasizing the role of specific mutations like IDH1 in differentiating primary and secondary glioblastomas. It explores the metabolic aspects of gliomas, including the "Warburg effect" and the involvement of genes like cMYC and IDH1/2 in aberrant metabolism. The study investigates the relationship between cMYC expression and clinical/pathological factors in human diffuse gliomas, analyzing data from immunohistochemistry, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Results show associations between cMYC expression, p53, and IDH1 mutations in malignant gliomas, with cMYC expression being linked to improved survival in adult glioblastomas. The text also delves into the impact of cMYC expression on prognosis in IDH1 mutant gliomas and its association with increased proliferation and WHO grade. Additionally, it discusses the potential interaction between cMYC and IDH1 mutations in gliomagenesis and the complexity of cMYC regulation at the post-transcriptional level. Further research is suggested to fully understand the prognostic value of cMYC expression in gliomas and its relationship with IDH1 mutations.
