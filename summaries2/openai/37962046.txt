Neurotensin (NTS) is a neuropeptide that acts through its receptors NTSR1 and NTSR2, which are G-protein-coupled receptors. NTSR2, a sortilin family member, is involved in various physiological and pathological processes, with potential roles in psychiatric disorders, pain regulation, and cancer. NTSR2 is expressed in the brain, spinal cord, and digestive system, and its functions include regulating fear, addiction, anxiety, and pain. Research has explored NTSR2's involvement in neuronal circuits, synaptic transmission, and neuroinflammation. NTSR2 may also play a role in cell survival, apoptosis resistance, and tumor progression. While NTSR2 has been studied in relation to various cancers, including gastric, colorectal, and pancreatic cancer, more research is needed to fully understand its implications. The text emphasizes the need for further investigation into NTSR2 to uncover its potential in different physiological and
