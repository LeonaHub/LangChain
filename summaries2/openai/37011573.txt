Collagen is a vital protein found in vertebrates and is widely used in industries like food, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics. While collagen is typically sourced from terrestrial animals, there is growing interest in collagen derived from aquatic species like the soft-shelled turtle due to concerns about disease transmission and cultural dietary restrictions. Soft-shelled turtle calipash is rich in collagen and has potential applications in pharmaceutical and cosmetic products. However, there is a lack of studies on the quality control of calipash and its products. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics and peptidomics are emerging as effective methods for identifying species-specific peptide biomarkers in collagen products. A study utilized mathematical set analysis, statistical analysis, and bioinformatics to identify peptide biomarkers specific to calipash and its products, focusing on collagen type I. The research involved peptidomics analysis of soft-shelled turtle gelatin extracts to identify specific
