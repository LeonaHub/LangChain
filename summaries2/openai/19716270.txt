The text discusses the importance of investigating methods to maximize outcomes of cognitive remediation interventions for schizophrenia by focusing on intrinsic motivation (IM) in neurocognitive recovery. Studies show that IM plays a meditational role between neurocognition and psychosocial functioning in schizophrenia. Impairments in the motivation and reward system in schizophrenia impact hedonic experiences and understanding the value of training tasks and rewards. The text suggests enhancing patients' intrinsic enjoyment and value of cognitive training rather than relying solely on external incentives. By utilizing teaching techniques that enhance intrinsic motivation, cognitive treatment for conditions like schizophrenia can be more effective. A study evaluated the impact of different learning interventions on participants' arithmetic skills, psychiatric symptomatology, and treatment engagement in schizophrenia treatment. Results showed that the motivational math game group had greater gains in arithmetic ability, intrinsic motivation, perceived self-competency, and attention. The study found that enhancing perceptions of self-competency in individuals with schizophrenia can improve learning outcomes. The study highlights the importance of perceived competency and autonomy in influencing intrinsic motivation and learning behavior. Future research could explore the relationship between treatment-specific, trait, and cross-situational instructional manipulations to gain insights into motivation, cognition, and psychosocial rehabilitation in schizophrenia.
