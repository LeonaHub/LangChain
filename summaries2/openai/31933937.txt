Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive form of breast cancer lacking certain receptors, leading to poor outcomes. Rho-GTPases, including Rho-GAPs like DLC-3, are associated with various cancers and play a role in inhibiting cancer cell proliferation. A study investigated DLC-3's role in TNBC tumor growth, invasion, and its potential interactions with the Wnt signaling pathway. Clinical samples from TNBC patients were collected, and various molecular techniques were used, including immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and cell culture assays. The study found that DLC-3 expression is reduced in poorly differentiated TNBC samples and is associated with lymph node metastasis and histologic grade. DLC-3 overexpression inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion in breast cancer cells. It was also shown to regulate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by upregulating GSK-3β and downregulating β-catenin and c-myc. The study suggests DLC-3 may act as a tumor suppressor in TNBC, with potential for targeting in treatment. Further research is needed to understand its molecular pathway fully.
