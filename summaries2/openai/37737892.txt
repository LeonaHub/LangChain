Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection, primarily transmitted through zoonotic sources, has been associated with neurological symptoms such as neuralgic amyotrophy, Guillain–Barré syndrome, and encephalitis. Diagnostic testing involves detecting anti-HEV antibodies and HEV RNA in serum or stool. Treatment for hepatic manifestations of acute HEV infection is usually unnecessary, but severe cases may require antiviral therapy. Cortisone and intravenous immunoglobulins have shown positive effects in cases of neuralgic amyotrophy caused by HEV. A study evaluated patients with acute HEV infection and neurological conditions, finding associations between HEV infection and neurological manifestations. The study included patients with various neurological conditions and analyzed their serological testing results. Liver enzyme levels were slightly elevated in most cases, and CSF analysis showed mild blood-CSF barrier dysfunction in patients with extrahepatic manifestations of acute HEV infection. The study identified cases of neuralgic amyotrophy/plexus neuritis and encephalitis as common neurological manifestations of HEV. Further research is needed to explore therapeutic strategies for neurological manifestations of HEV and to differentiate between acute and post-acute infection syndromes. Regional variations in HEV seroprevalence and genotypes should be considered when diagnosing neurological manifestations of HEV. The study suggests that HEV may be a potential cause of certain neurological symptoms and emphasizes the importance of testing for HEV-RNA and anti-HEV antibodies in various bodily fluids to secure the diagnosis.
