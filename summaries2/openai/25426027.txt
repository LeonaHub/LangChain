Chronic cranial windows have been instrumental in advancing in vivo optical imaging studies in small animals like mice, enabling long-term high-resolution imaging in various brain regions. These windows have facilitated a range of imaging techniques on a single specimen over an extended period, including in both anesthetized and awake animals. While acute cranial windows have allowed for combining two-photon imaging and electrophysiology, techniques that combine chronic imaging with direct cellular recording or manipulation require more complex surgeries and window designs. There is a current need for a simple device that can combine chronic imaging with easy physical access to the brain in small animals like mice. A method for creating a chronic cranial window with an access port or silicone plug for conducting various cellular manipulations in animal experiments has been described. The device allows for drug delivery, sample extractions, electrophysiological recording, and stimulation while maintaining animal health and preventing brain contamination. The process involves preparing a glass window with a silicone access port, which is easy to fabricate and adaptable for long-term use. Animal experiments were conducted following ethical guidelines. The text also details a study that assessed the reliability and repeatability of a technique involving repeated injections of a calcium-sensitive dye into the cortical layer 2/3 of the barrel cortex in mice, as well as a study involving the chronic cranial window with an access port for conducting targeted
