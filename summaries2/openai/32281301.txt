Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a poor prognosis, with treatment options varying based on the tumor's stage. Surgical resection is the main curative treatment for localized PDAC, but only a small percentage of cases are resectable at diagnosis. Adjuvant chemotherapy is standard post-surgery, and neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) can improve resectability and prognosis for borderline and unresectable cases. Current methods like CT imaging may not accurately assess treatment effects in PDAC, with only a small percentage of studies using RECIST guidelines. 18F‐Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F‐FDG‐PET) may offer advantages over CT for evaluating treatment effects in PDAC, with the Positron Emission Tomography Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (PERCIST) being useful for assessing treatment effects in various cancers. Studies have shown that PET/CT parameters, such as metabolic tumor volume (MTV), can reflect tumor activity and prognosis in PDAC. A study evaluated the prognostic utility of FDG PET/CT parameters in PDAC patients who underwent NAT followed by surgery, focusing on treatment effect using PERCIST based on pathological treatment response (PTR) and analyzing prognostic factors over a 5-year period. The study used FDG PET/CT and contrast-enhanced CT scans to assess tumor resectability and treatment response, with PET/CT parameters like SUVmax, SULpeak, and TLG being analyzed. The study found that PERCIST was more effective than RECIST in predicting treatment response and residual cellularity, with MTV identified as a good predictor for recurrence and survival. The reduction rate of MTV before and after NAT was found to be a better predictor of recurrence and survival compared to other imaging parameters. The study highlights the importance of accurately assessing the therapeutic effect of NAT in PDAC patients and suggests that precise evaluation of PET/CT parameters could improve prognostic stratification and treatment outcomes.
