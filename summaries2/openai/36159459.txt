The text emphasizes the importance of gut microbiota (GM) in human health and discusses the positive effects of dietary fiber from sweet potato peels on immunity, blood lipids, anti-aging, and anti-oxidation. It highlights the role of dietary factors in influencing GM composition and health outcomes, focusing on the benefits of dietary fiber in regulating GM structure. The text describes various extraction methods for obtaining dietary fiber from sweet potato peels and their effects on intestinal fermentation, gas production, short-chain fatty acid production, and microbial diversity. Studies show that sweet potato peel fiber can promote beneficial gut microbiota species, improve gut bacteria balance, and impact gas production and short-chain fatty acid production in the intestines. The text also discusses the significance of propionic acid and butyric acid produced by bacterial breakdown of dietary fiber, as well as the importance of intestinal pH and dietary fiber in regulating harmful bacteria growth and reducing ammonia content in the gut. Additionally, the text highlights the potential of sweet potato dietary fiber to improve intestinal health by increasing beneficial bacteria and reducing harmful bacteria, ultimately promoting gut health and overall well-being.
