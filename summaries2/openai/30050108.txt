Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene, leading to a range of metabolic phenotypes from mild to severe. Over 900 mutations have been identified in the PAH gene, influencing disease severity. Research has focused on understanding genotype-phenotype correlations in PKU patients, with recent studies analyzing patient alleles to predict disease severity and tailor treatments. Studies have identified specific mutations associated with classic PKU, mild PKU, and mild hyperphenylalaninemia, highlighting the impact of mutations on PKU phenotypes. The severity of PKU is often determined by the less severe mutation in the PAH gene, with some mutations allowing for residual enzyme activity and resulting in less severe phenotypes. However, there can be discrepancies between predicted mutation severity and actual clinical presentation, indicating the complexity of genotype-phenotype correlations in PKU. Further research is needed to fully understand the influence of different mutations on PKU phenotypes and treatment responses.
