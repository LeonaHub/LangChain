Cancer incidence is on the rise in Japan, leading to increased availability of effective cancer treatments. The surge in new oncology drugs has resulted in higher treatment costs, with some patients facing economic burdens despite the High-Cost Medical Expense Benefit system. Studies show that a significant percentage of oncology patients refuse or discontinue drug treatment due to economic reasons. Treatment cost is a major concern for both physicians and patients, impacting treatment decisions. A study in Japan focused on how treatment costs influence decisions for chronic myelogenous leukemia and transplant-ineligible multiple myeloma patients, revealing that a percentage of patients may receive non-optimal treatment due to cost considerations. Factors such as age, occupation status, and treatment duration were identified as influencing patients' choices. The study also highlighted the impact of treatment cost on physician recommendations, with some physicians more likely to recommend non-optimal treatment due to cost, particularly in later lines of therapy. Despite limitations in the study design, it emphasizes the need for further research to better understand the factors affecting treatment decisions related to cost in Japan.
