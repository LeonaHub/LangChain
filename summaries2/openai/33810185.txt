Barley grain is rich in bioactive compounds like dietary fiber, phenolic compounds, tocols, sterols, and folates, which offer various health benefits. Î²-glucans, arabinoxylans, and phenolic compounds in barley help maintain normal blood cholesterol levels, reduce blood glucose, improve immune response, and lower the risk of cardiovascular disease, inflammation, and cancer. The accumulation of these compounds during barley grain filling is crucial for determining grain weight, nutrient composition, and quality. High temperatures during grain filling can impact grain weight and composition of bioactive compounds, affecting the nutritional value of barley. Research on the dynamics of bioactive compounds during grain development is essential for enhancing barley's nutritional quality. A study compared the accumulation of bioactive compounds in barley genotypes under high temperatures, finding that genotype plays a significant role in determining the content of these compounds. Heat stress influenced grain weight and increased phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity, with some genotypes showing higher antioxidant capacity. The study suggests further research is needed to understand how high temperatures affect the structure of bioactive compounds during grain accumulation. Overall, the research highlights the importance of genotype in determining the levels of bioactive compounds in barley and the impact of high temperatures on these compounds.
