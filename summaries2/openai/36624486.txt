Dementia is a global health concern without a complete cure, leading to research on potential risk factors for prevention. Studies suggest a link between brisk walking pace and lower dementia risk, while grip strength is associated with negative health outcomes. Combining walking pace and grip strength may offer a stronger association with health outcomes. A study investigated the association between walking pace, grip strength, and dementia risk, utilizing data from the UK Biobank. The study found that brisk walking pace and higher grip strength were associated with a lower risk of dementia, even after adjusting for various factors. The relationship between walking pace and dementia risk varied based on age and genetic factors. The study highlights the importance of considering physical function, genetic profile, and age together to identify individuals at risk of dementia.
