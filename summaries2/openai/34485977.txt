Several studies have been conducted to investigate the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with COVID-19, particularly in hospitalized individuals. The prevalence rates of VTE in COVID-19 patients vary, with higher rates observed in ICU settings compared to non-ICU patients. A retrospective observational study in Sweden aimed to assess the risk and prevalence of VTE during the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study found no significant difference in VTE incidence among patients with positive COVID-19 tests in 2020 compared to previous years, suggesting that COVID-19 status alone should not dictate VTE workup in emergency departments. The study also highlighted the importance of risk stratification for VTE in COVID-19 patients and emphasized the higher prevalence of VTE in ICU patients. Despite limitations in the study, including missing data on SARS-CoV-2 status in some patients, the results indicated that COVID-19 did not significantly increase the odds of VTE when adjusting for known risk factors and anticoagulation treatment. Further research is recommended to confirm these findings and explore the impact of COVID-19 on VTE risk in different patient populations.
