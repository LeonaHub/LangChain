Vitamin A deficiency is a significant concern for lactating women and infants in developing countries, including China. A study conducted in urban Chinese women aimed to assess their vitamin A status through dietary intake, serum concentrations, and breast milk levels. The study found that higher dietary vitamin A intake was associated with increased serum and breast milk vitamin A concentrations. However, a small percentage of women met the recommended nutrient intake for vitamin A, with factors like weight, obesity, and parity influencing their vitamin A status. The study emphasized the importance of adequate vitamin A intake for the health of mother-infant pairs and suggested food-based interventions to address deficiencies. The research also highlighted the need for more accurate dietary assessment methods and further investigation into the impact of body weight and parity on vitamin A levels in lactating women.
