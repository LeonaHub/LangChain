The text discusses the impact of pollution, particularly from sources like car exhaust fumes, on climate change and public health. It highlights the dangers of air pollution in congested areas and the associated health risks and costs. The focus is on road transport as a major contributor to CO2 emissions, with pressure on vehicle manufacturers to reduce emissions. Studies have shown the effectiveness of emission controls in reducing particulate matter but less impact on nitrogen dioxide levels. The importance of emission regulation in car production and the role of electronics in optimizing engine combustion to reduce emissions are also emphasized. The text discusses the importance of monitoring fuel consumption and emissions in vehicles, particularly through the use of On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) tools. These tools help control emissions by detecting and generating data trouble codes for faulty components. Emission inspections are conducted regularly to assess vehicle conditions and ensure they meet legal emission standards. However, due to factors like insufficient maintenance and aging vehicles, many on-road vehicles may not meet these standards. The text also highlights a decrease in new vehicle sales in the European Union, leading to a higher average age of vehicles and potentially worse technical conditions. The text discusses a research study that focused on changes in engine power and exhaust emissions of a vehicle by disconnecting electronic components of the engine management system. The study was conducted in laboratory conditions using a cylinder power test room and an exhaust gas analyzer. The research methodology involved comparing engine power and emissions measurements with and without electronic component disconnections. The study also evaluated emissions from different perspectives, including individual components of exhaust gases, fault memory monitoring, and malfunction indicator
