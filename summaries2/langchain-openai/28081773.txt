The bone marrow niche is a complex environment containing various cell types, including hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) that differentiate into osteoblasts and adipocytes. These cells have distinct metabolic requirements for energy production, with glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation playing key roles. The balance between osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation is influenced by factors like hypoxia, transcription factors, and metabolic pathways. Marrow adiposity has been linked to various clinical conditions such as osteoporosis, anorexia nervosa, obesity, and diabetes, affecting bone health and fracture risk. Intervention studies have shown that treatments like estrogen, bisphosphonates, and exercise can decrease marrow fat and improve bone mineral density. Mechanisms involving transcription factors, hormones, and signaling pathways regulate the differentiation of MSCs into osteoblasts or adipocytes. Future research aims to elucidate the relationship between marrow adipocytes, metabolic status, and bone remodeling for potential therapeutic advancements in obesity and osteoporosis.
