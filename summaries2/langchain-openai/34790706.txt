The study focused on evaluating the association between sVCAM-1 plasma levels and cardiac structural changes in long-distance runners before and after intense exercise. The research found that highly trained runners had elevated sVCAM-1 levels compared to moderately trained and non-active individuals. There was a significant increase in sVCAM-1 levels post-marathon, particularly in highly trained runners. The study also revealed a moderate correlation between sVCAM-1 levels and left atrial volume, suggesting sVCAM-1 as a potential biomarker for adverse consequences on atrial structure and function in high-performance athletes. The findings propose sVCAM-1 as a predictor for atrial fibrillation risk in athletes, highlighting the need for further prospective studies to validate these results.
