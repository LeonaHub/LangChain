The text discusses the challenges of identifying sepsis in the prehospital setting and the limitations of using Early Warning Scores (EWS) for this purpose. A scoping review of 23 studies found that EWS tools performed inconsistently and inadequately for prehospital sepsis identification. The studies showed variations in sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of different EWS. The experts consulted suggested that standardized protocols, enhanced education, and adjunctive tools like EtCO2 monitoring or heart rate variability could aid in prehospital sepsis identification. However, the review highlighted limitations such as heterogeneity in study methodologies, small sample sizes, and lack of high-quality data. The conclusion emphasizes the need to focus on standardized prehospital care, interventions for acutely unstable patients, and improving sepsis education for EMS personnel rather than relying solely on EWS for prehospital sepsis identification. Future research should evaluate the impact of these interventions on patient outcomes.
