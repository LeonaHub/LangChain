The text discusses a study focusing on the 3D histomorphometric quantification of optic nerve head (ONH) and peripapillary neural and connective tissues in monkeys with early experimental glaucoma. The study aims to detect permanent connective tissue deformation at the onset of glaucomatous damage. The findings reveal permanent posterior deformation and thickening of the lamina cribrosa, scleral flange, and peripapillary sclera in the eyes with glaucoma. The study emphasizes the importance of understanding these structural changes in relation to glaucomatous damage and suggests that visualization of these deep structures could be crucial in clinical glaucoma imaging for assessing individual susceptibility to the disease. Additionally, the study proposes that detecting deformation and thickness changes in these structures may serve as an early marker for the development and progression of glaucoma.
