The study investigated the association between H. influenzae and conjunctivitis, acute otitis media, and acute bacterial paranasal sinusitis in children. A total of 67 children were included, with H. influenzae being the most prevalent pathogen. The study identified a potential "conjunctivitis-otitis media-sinusitis syndrome" with a shared pathogenic process. The high antibiotic resistance rates of H. influenzae, particularly to amoxicillin-clavulanate, were noted. The study highlighted the importance of understanding these associations for appropriate antibiotic treatment and the potential need for effective vaccines against H. influenzae. The methods included bacterial culture testing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing, with statistical analysis conducted to assess differences among variables.
