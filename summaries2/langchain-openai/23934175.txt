The study investigated the association of cMYC expression with clinical and pathological variables in infiltrating gliomas. The research analyzed 171 gliomas, finding that cMYC expression correlated with mutant IDH1 (R132H) and strong p53 co-expression in malignant gliomas. cMYC expression was more frequent in anaplastic astrocytomas and associated with younger age at diagnosis. The study also examined cMYC mRNA expression and DNA copy number alterations in TCGA datasets, showing a correlation with IDH1 mutations. Survival analyses revealed that cMYC expression was linked to improved survival in malignant gliomas but increased risk of death in IDH1 (R132H) mutants. The study suggests that cMYC may be an adverse prognostic factor in IDH1 mutant gliomas and calls for further research to understand the complex relationship between cMYC expression, IDH1 mutations, and glioma prognosis.
