The text discusses the identification and characterization of cadmium-responsive genes, specifically CDR-1, CDR-4, and CDR-6, in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. These genes are involved in defense against cadmium toxicity and potentially play a role in osmoregulation. The study explores the transcriptional regulation, cellular expression patterns, and functional consequences of inhibiting CDR-4 and CDR-6 expression through RNA interference. The genes are found to be expressed in intestinal and pharyngeal muscle cells, with CDR-4 and CDR-6 being targeted to lysosomes. Inhibition of CDR-4 and CDR-6 expression leads to fluid accumulation in the nematodes, suggesting a disruption in osmoregulation. The study also investigates the effects of metal exposure and hypotonic stress on gene expression and lifespan, indicating potential roles of the CDR genes in response to environmental stressors. Further analysis of the GATA elements and regulatory pathways controlling gene expression is suggested to gain a deeper understanding of the biological functions of the CDR gene family.
