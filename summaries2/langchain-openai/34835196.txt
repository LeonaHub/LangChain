The text discusses the development of a double-antibody sandwich ELISA for detecting the MCP antigen concentration in inactivated Infectious Spleen and Kidney Necrosis Virus (ISKNV) vaccines. The study involved generating monoclonal antibodies against ISKNV, purifying the antibodies, expressing and purifying the MCP antigen, and establishing the ELISA assay. The ELISA method was found to be sensitive, convenient, and accurate in measuring antigen concentrations in the vaccines. The assay's sensitivity and specificity make it a valuable tool for quantitatively detecting antigens in inactivated ISKNV vaccines, providing a reliable means of assessing vaccine quality.
