The text discusses the role of DLC-3, a Rho-GTPase-activating protein, in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). It highlights that DLC-3 is downregulated in TNBC tissues and its expression correlates with lymph node status and histologic grade. Through experiments involving cell cultures and transfection, it was found that upregulation of DLC-3 inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion in TNBC cells. Additionally, DLC-3 was shown to interact with the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway, suppressing its activity. The study suggests that DLC-3 may act as a tumor suppressor in TNBC and provides a basis for further research on targeting DLC-3 in TNBC treatment.
