The text discusses a study conducted in Seoul, South Korea, using data from the 2017 Seoul Survey to examine the association between companion animal ownership and overall life satisfaction. The study found that pet ownership was positively associated with higher levels of overall life satisfaction. Specifically, pet owners with both dogs and cats reported the highest satisfaction levels, followed by single pet owners of either a cat or a dog. The study also analyzed the impact of the number of pets owned on life satisfaction, with single pet ownership associated with higher satisfaction levels compared to owning two or more pets. The research utilized propensity score matching to establish causal relationships and highlighted the need for future studies to consider the duration and history of pet ownership. Despite limitations, the study provides valuable insights into the relationship between pet ownership and human well-being, advocating for further research on the companion animal effect and its potential benefits on health and well-being.
