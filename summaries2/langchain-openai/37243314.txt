The study investigated the impact of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals on the circadian clock in THP-1 macrophages and its role in NLRP3 inflammasome activation, a key process in gout flares. MSU crystal exposure altered the expression of clock components, with increased PER2 and CRY1, and reduced BMAL1 and REV-ERBα levels. BMAL1 and REV-ERBα were found to repress NLRP3 inflammasome activation induced by MSU crystals. Time-of-day differences were observed in MSU crystal-induced inflammasome activation, with maximal activity when BMAL1 levels were low. The study suggests that circadian control of immune cell function, influenced by MSU crystals, may contribute to the nocturnal risk of gout flares. The findings highlight the potential role of the circadian clock in inflammatory responses and suggest implications for other conditions with time-of-day symptom manifestation.
