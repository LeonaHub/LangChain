The text discusses a prospective cohort study conducted to measure cervical softness in twin and singleton pregnancies using shear wave elastography (SWE). The study found that cervical softness, as measured by SWE at the lower point of the cervix, was significantly lower in twin pregnancies compared to singleton pregnancies during the mid-trimester. The study highlights the potential of SWE as a tool for monitoring cervical softness in twin pregnancies and suggests further research is needed to explore its role in preterm surveillance for twin pregnancies.
