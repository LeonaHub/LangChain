The text discusses the impact of insulin-induced hypoglycemia (IIH) on pulsatile luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion in estrogen-primed ovariectomized rats. It explores how IIH suppresses LH secretion by decreasing the activity of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulse generator. The study demonstrates that glucose plays a critical role in maintaining the activity of GnRH neurons, as it rapidly recovers the suppressed LH secretion caused by IIH. Fructose, which does not cross the blood-brain barrier, takes longer to have an effect compared to glucose, suggesting a direct central nervous system action of glucose. Other carbohydrates like fructose, galactose, xylose, and lactate do not have the same effect as glucose, indicating a specific role of glucose in synaptic function. Mannose behaves similarly to glucose, possibly due to its ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. The study concludes that glucose availability, rather than just metabolic state, is essential for maintaining the electrical activity of the GnRH pulse generator and pulsatile LH secretion.
