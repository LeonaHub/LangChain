The text discusses a study on cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) using three-dimensional electrical body surface mapping to assess electrical activation in patients with heart failure. The study aimed to evaluate the consistency of electrical activation in the right and left ventricles over time and its correlation with cardiac MRI, as well as to predict CRT response measures related to LV function, peak oxygen consumption, and neurohormonal activation. The study included 30 patients with an indication for CRT and found that novel parameters of RV and LV activation, such as RV80 and LV80, were more accurate predictors of CRT response than the traditional QRS duration. The study also examined the impact of pacing strategies on electrical activation rates and clinical response, highlighting the importance of RV-specific and LV-specific assessments in predicting CRT outcomes. The findings suggest that three-dimensional electrical mapping can guide CRT pacing strategies and predict response measures based on the resynchronization pacing strategy employed. The study demonstrates the potential clinical impact of three-dimensional body surface electrical mapping in optimizing CRT outcomes and informing pacing strategies for patients with heart failure.
