The study investigated the use of transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) paired with notched music therapy for treating refractory chronic tinnitus in patients. Thirty patients with subjective tinnitus were included, and tVNS was applied using a patch-type electrode on the left auricular concha. The treatment sessions resulted in improvements in subjective symptom severity, tinnitus loudness, and tinnitus awareness in a significant percentage of patients. No specific side effects were reported, indicating the safety of the approach. However, the study had limitations such as being a single-group pilot study without a control group and a short duration of follow-up. Further research with control groups and objective measures is needed to confirm the effectiveness and long-term outcomes of tVNS paired with notched music therapy for tinnitus treatment.
