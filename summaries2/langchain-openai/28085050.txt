The text discusses the association between the MTHFR gene polymorphisms, particularly C677T, and the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It highlights the impact of environmental factors, specifically air pollution, on the development of AD in individuals with MTHFR gene mutations. The study conducted meta-analyses and meta-predictive analyses to explore these associations across different geographic regions. The findings suggest that MTHFR C677T polymorphism is linked to an increased risk of AD, with variations observed in different populations. The text emphasizes the importance of understanding gene-environment interactions and epigenetic factors in the development of AD, particularly in regions with high levels of air pollution. Proactive strategies are recommended to prevent AD and promote the health of vulnerable populations in areas with significant air pollution.
