The study conducted at a tertiary hospital in Queensland, Australia, analyzed 171 patients who underwent ileostomy formation. The research found a high readmission rate of 38%, with dehydration being a common cause. Patients who were readmitted within 60 days did not show significant differences in baseline characteristics compared to those who were not readmitted. However, there was a significant decrease in renal function following ileostomy formation in all patients, regardless of readmission status. Serum sodium levels were associated with an increased risk of readmission, likely due to the risk of AKI. The study suggests that efforts to improve hydration in ileostomy patients should be implemented universally, as renal function deterioration was observed in all patients with an ileostomy.
