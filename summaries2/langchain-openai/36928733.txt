The text discusses myoepithelial lesions in the head and neck region, focusing on myoepithelioma and myoepithelial carcinoma. Myoepithelioma is a rare benign salivary gland neoplasm composed of myoepithelial cells without ductal components, while myoepithelial carcinoma is a malignant counterpart with invasive growth. The article covers the histological features, immunohistochemistry markers, differential diagnoses, and molecular studies associated with these lesions. It emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive approach, including a logical differential diagnosis algorithm and targeted immunohistochemistry evaluation to accurately diagnose and differentiate these tumors from other entities in the head and neck region.
