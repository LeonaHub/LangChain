The text discusses a pharmacovigilance study conducted in the Campania region of Italy to assess the preventability of bleeding cases related to oral anticoagulant therapy. The study analyzed Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) from July 2012 to December 2017, focusing on cases where oral anticoagulants were suspected drugs. The study found that a significant percentage of bleeding cases were preventable, with critical criteria related to healthcare professionals' practices being the most common factors. The study highlighted the importance of appropriate drug use, especially in elderly patients, and identified drug-drug interactions as a key risk factor for adverse events. The findings suggest the need for improved pharmacovigilance activities and initiatives to enhance the safe use of oral anticoagulants in clinical practice.
