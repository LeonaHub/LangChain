The text describes a study conducted to evaluate the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in mice and golden Syrian hamsters. The study involved the development of adenovirus vectors expressing the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 with or without an autophagy-inducing peptide (AIP-C5). Mice and hamsters were immunized with these vectors and subsequently challenged with SARS-CoV-2 to assess vaccine efficacy. The study included analyses of humoral immune responses, cell-mediated immune responses, virus neutralization, and protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The results showed that the vaccine induced robust immune responses, reduced virus titers in the respiratory tract, and provided protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the animal models. Histopathological analysis of lung samples also demonstrated reduced lung pathology in vaccinated animals. The study highlights the potential of the vaccine, including the role of AIP-C5 in enhancing T cell responses, in providing protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants.
