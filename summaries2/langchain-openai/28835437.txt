The study introduced a novel CLEC-2 Y7A knockin mouse model that maintained surface expression of a signaling-dead CLEC-2 receptor. The model exhibited a developmental phenotype similar to constitutive CLEC-2 knockout models, highlighting the role of CLEC-2 signaling in preventing lymphatic blood-filling. Interestingly, the study revealed a signaling-independent function of CLEC-2 in thrombus stability, distinct from its hemITAM signaling cascade. The use of an antibody Fabâ€² fragment to block mutant CLEC-2 suggested the importance of a specific domain in CLEC-2 for its thrombus-stabilizing role. Further research is needed to identify the blood-borne ligand/counterreceptor of CLEC-2 responsible for its adhesive function in thrombosis and hemostasis.
