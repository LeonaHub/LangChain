The text discusses the process undertaken by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) to revise the definition of pain. The task force, comprised of experts in pain research and care, engaged in discussions, consultations with ethicists and philosophers, and sought feedback from the global pain community. The revised definition emphasizes pain as an aversive sensory and emotional experience associated with tissue injury, or resembling such injury. The notes highlight the subjective nature of pain, its distinction from nociception, and the impact of pain on individuals. Feedback from the public was considered in making adjustments to the definition and notes, with a focus on clarity and inclusivity. The revised definition aims to encompass various forms of pain, including nociplastic pain, and acknowledges the complexity of chronic pain conditions. The final recommendations were unanimously approved by the IASP Council, reflecting a commitment to ongoing updates in line with advancements in pain research and care.
