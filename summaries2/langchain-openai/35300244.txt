Aortic intramural haematomas (AIH) are now defined as thrombosed aortic dissections and typically affect older females with cardiovascular risk factors, often involving the descending aorta. Symptoms are non-specific, and diagnosis is typically made using computed tomography (CT). While CT remains the gold standard, MRI techniques are also used, although they have limitations. Treatment options for AIH type B include medical therapy for stable patients and thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) for those with complications. TEVAR aims to exclude the entry tear and re-expand the true aortic lumen but can have complications such as aortic dissection. Careful patient selection and monitoring are crucial in deciding on the appropriate treatment approach.
