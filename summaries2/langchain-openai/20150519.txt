The text discusses a study on ion fluxes in the pitchers of three Nepenthes species: N. rafflesiana, N. ampullaria, and N. bicalcarata. The study used the MIFE technique to measure NH4+ and H+ fluxes across the pitcher walls of these species. It also examined gland distribution and morphology in the pitchers. The results showed that N. rafflesiana had the highest NH4+ uptake rate, reflecting its high prey capture rate, while N. ampullaria derived N from leaf litter inputs and showed slower NH4+ uptake. N. bicalcarata had a mutualistic association with ants and actively maintained less acidic pitcher conditions. Interestingly, zones D and E in N. rafflesiana exhibited ion fluxes despite lacking multicellular glands, suggesting a potential primitive form of digestive glands in the epidermal cells beneath the lunate cells. The study provides insights into the nutrient sequestration strategies and adaptations of these carnivorous pitcher plants.
