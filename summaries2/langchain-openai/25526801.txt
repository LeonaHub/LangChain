The text discusses the development and characterization of a recombinant RGD-hirudin, a thrombin inhibitor derived from the leech, for potential use in anti-coagulation and anti-thrombosis treatments. The study involved molecular modeling, docking simulations, mutagenesis studies, protein purification, and functional assays to understand the interaction between RGD-hirudin and thrombin. Results indicated that specific residues in RGD-hirudin, particularly Tyr3, Ser50, Gln53, Asp55, Glu57, and Ile59, play crucial roles in inhibiting thrombin activity and forming hydrogen bonds with the thrombin exosite. The study provides insights into the structural basis of RGD-hirudin's interaction with thrombin, which could aid in the development of new oral antithrombin peptides for combating thrombotic diseases.
