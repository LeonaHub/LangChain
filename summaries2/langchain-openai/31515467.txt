The study investigated the role of circ_0079993, a circular RNA derived from the POLR2J4 gene, in colorectal cancer (CRC). Circ_0079993 was found to be upregulated in CRC tissues and cell lines, correlating with poor prognosis. Knockdown of circ_0079993 inhibited CRC cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. It was shown to act as a sponge for multiple miRNAs, particularly miR-203a-3p.1, and regulate the expression of CREB1 by sponging miR-203a-3p.1. Anti-miR-203a-3p.1 reversed the effects of circ_0079993 knockdown on CRC cell proliferation. The study highlighted the complex regulatory network involving circ_0079993, miRNAs, and CREB1 in CRC progression, suggesting potential therapeutic targets. Further research is needed to explore additional functional mechanisms of circ_0079993 in CRC and to understand the intricate circRNA regulatory networks in CRC pathogenesis.
