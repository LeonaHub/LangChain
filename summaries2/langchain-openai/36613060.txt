The text discusses a study conducted in China to assess the psychometric properties of the Children's Eating Attitude Test (ChEAT) in Chinese children aged 9 to 13 years. The study found that the Chinese version of the ChEAT demonstrated high internal consistency, reliability, and validity. Exploratory factor analysis revealed four factors related to eating behaviors, with factors such as fear of getting fat and dieting behaviors showing significant differences between genders and BMI groups. The study highlighted gender differences in eating behaviors, with girls showing more fear of getting fat and social pressure to eat, while boys exhibited higher levels of bulimia and food preoccupation. The study also found correlations between ChEAT scores and BMI, indicating that overweight girls had more eating disorder problems than normal-weight girls, and boys with lower BMI experienced higher social eating pressure. The study concludes that the Chinese version of the ChEAT is a valuable tool for assessing eating attitudes and behaviors in Chinese children and may aid in cross-cultural comparative studies on eating disorders in children.
