The text discusses the characterization of the IFNL4 gene, a unique member of the interferon lambda family, and its regulatory mechanisms in response to viral infection. The study investigates the low expression of IFNL4 mRNA compared to canonical IFNs in various human and animal cell types. Through experiments involving promoter activity assays, chimeric constructs, and chromatin immunoprecipitation, the study reveals that the IFNL4 gene is regulated differently from canonical IFNs, with a nonfunctional or poorly functional IRF3 binding site and functional NF-ÎºB sites. The evolutionary conservation of the IFNL4 promoter's sequence and functional characteristics across mammalian species is also highlighted. The study provides insights into the distinct regulatory mechanisms of the IFNL4 gene and its role in antiviral responses.
