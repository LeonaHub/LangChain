The text discusses a study conducted in Japan that examined the impact of treatment cost on the decisions made by physicians and patients regarding the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and transplant-ineligible multiple myeloma (MM). The study found that while treatment cost did not lead to non-optimal treatment for most patients, a significant percentage of patients with CML and MM may undergo non-optimal treatment due to cost considerations. The study revealed that treatment cost influenced physician recommendations and patient adherence to prescribed treatment dosing and frequency. Factors such as patient age, occupation status, household composition, and duration of treatment were identified as characteristics that might lead patients to undergo non-optimal treatment due to cost. The study highlighted differences in the impact of treatment cost on CML and MM patients, with CML patients being more affected by cost considerations. The study also discussed physician attitudes towards treatment cost and the importance of considering cost when choosing treatment regimens. Overall, the study suggests that while treatment cost is a significant consideration for physicians and patients in Japan, its impact on treatment decisions may be limited. Further research is recommended to explore the factors influencing decisions related to treatment cost among physicians and patients.
