The text discusses the significance of BORIS and SOCS3 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and their potential as prognostic biomarkers. BORIS, a DNA-binding protein, is found to be highly expressed in HCC tissues, correlating with larger tumors, poorer differentiation, and satellite lesion formation. On the other hand, SOCS3, a suppressor of cytokine signaling, shows lower expression in HCC, potentially contributing to tumor progression. The study reveals a negative correlation between BORIS and SOCS3 expression in HCC, suggesting a potential regulatory relationship. High BORIS expression and low SOCS3 expression are associated with increased risk of recurrence and poorer survival outcomes in HCC patients post-surgery. The combination of BORIS and SOCS3 expression provides better prognostic value than individual markers alone. The findings highlight the potential of BORIS and SOCS3 as prognostic indicators and potential therapeutic targets for HCC treatment. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of their interaction in HCC.
