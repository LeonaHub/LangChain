The study investigated the correlation between air pollutants and spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) in Taiwanese patients using big data analysis methods. The study integrated the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) with governmental open data on air pollutants. The findings indicated that NO2 pollution was highly correlated with sICH incidence, and the levels of PM10, PM2.5, and O3 often exceeded normal levels. Age was found to be a significant factor in the impact of air pollutants on sICH, with PM2.5 and PM10 identified as crucial risk factors for sICH in middle-aged and elderly patients. The study suggested the need for further research to adjust air pollution control policies and cut-off levels.
