The text discusses the utility of studying human sensory neuron models in preclinical pain research. It highlights the advantages of using in vitro models, such as reduced cost, ethical concerns, and ease of manipulation, compared to animal models. The discussion focuses on the recent advancements in human sensory neuron models, including hDRG neurons and SC-SNs derived from stem cells. These models offer opportunities to validate drug targets, study genetic forms of pain, and investigate environmental factors contributing to chronic pain. Challenges and limitations, such as variability in differentiation batches and the need for standardized protocols, are also addressed. The text emphasizes the importance of understanding the strengths and limitations of each model and the potential for cross-validation between human and rodent models to advance pain research.
