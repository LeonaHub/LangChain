The text discusses the interaction between viruses and sphingolipid metabolism, focusing on the roles of sphingosine kinase (SK) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) lyase in regulating virus replication. It highlights the impact of SK and S1P lyase on influenza virus replication, with SK promoting viral replication and S1P lyase inhibiting it. The text also delves into the modulation of SK activity by various viruses such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and dengue virus type-2 (DENV-2). Additionally, it discusses the involvement of cellular signaling pathways like NF-ÎºB and ERK MAPK in the regulation of viral replication by SK inhibition. The text emphasizes the importance of understanding the interplay between viruses and sphingolipid metabolism for developing novel strategies to combat viral infections.
