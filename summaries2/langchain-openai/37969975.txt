The text discusses the development and characterization of chitosan nanoparticles loaded with betaine (BT) and nedaplatin (ND) for potential breast cancer treatment. The study explores the use of PEGylated and non-PEGylated CS NPs to deliver BT and ND, aiming to enhance drug efficacy and reduce toxicity. Various analyses, including FTIR spectroscopy and release studies, were conducted to assess the nanoparticles' properties. In vitro cytotoxicity assays on MCF-7 cells showed enhanced anticancer activity of the nanoformulations compared to free drugs. In vivo studies on a breast cancer rat model demonstrated significant tumor size reduction with the BT-ND/PEG-CS NPs formulation. The findings suggest that these nanoparticles could be a promising therapeutic strategy for breast cancer treatment.
