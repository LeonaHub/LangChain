The study aimed to compare the effectiveness of chewing gum and tenoxicam for pain relief following initial archwire placement in orthodontic patients. A total of 40 female participants were divided into two groups, with one group using chewing gum and the other taking tenoxicam. Pain levels were assessed using a visual analog scale at various time points after treatment initiation. Results showed that both groups experienced a similar pattern of pain intensity, with peak pain occurring within 24 hours and gradually decreasing by the seventh day. Chewing gum was found to be as effective as tenoxicam in controlling orthodontic pain, particularly during chewing activities. The study suggests that chewing gum can be a non-pharmacological alternative for pain management in orthodontic patients, with similar efficacy to pre-emptive tenoxicam. Further research with larger sample sizes and multicenter trials are recommended to establish standardized protocols for pain management in orthodontic treatment.
