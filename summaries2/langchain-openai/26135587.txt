The text discusses the lack of evidence supporting non-pharmacological interventions for primary Sj√∂gren's syndrome (pSS) in adults. Five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were reviewed, but the studies had poor quality, high risk of bias, and small sample sizes. The interventions included punctal plugs, oral lubrication devices, acupuncture, and psychodynamic therapy, with inconclusive results on their effectiveness. The studies lacked appropriate outcome measures related to activity, participation, and quality of life. Further research is recommended, including investigating interventions like cognitive behavioral therapy and exercise training, which have shown efficacy in other conditions with similar symptoms. Overall, there is a need for well-conducted RCTs with relevant outcomes to assess non-pharmacological interventions for pSS.
