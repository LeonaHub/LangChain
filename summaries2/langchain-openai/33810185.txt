The study focused on the accumulation patterns of bioactive compounds in barley grain under high-temperature stress conditions. Four barley genotypes were compared for their content of dietary fiber, phenolic compounds, and antioxidant capacity. The study found that genotype had a greater influence on the content of these compounds than environmental factors. High temperature stress reduced grain weight but did not significantly affect the levels of Î²-glucans and arabinoxylans. The phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity increased under heat stress, especially in certain genotypes. The deposition patterns of these compounds varied throughout grain filling, with dietary fiber following the pattern of grain weight, and anthocyanins peaking before the end of grain filling. Free and bound phenols decreased as grains developed, with bound phenols showing sensitivity to genotypic changes. Overall, antioxidant capacity decreased over time, with a steeper decline in control plots compared to stress-induced ones. The study suggests that food barley cultivation in high-temperature stress-prone areas can lead to increased bioactive compounds and antioxidant capacity, even in smaller grains, and early harvesting of non-mature grains may maximize antioxidant capacity for use in healthy food products.
