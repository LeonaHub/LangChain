The text discusses a study that investigated the association between walking pace, handgrip strength, and the risk of dementia, particularly new-onset dementia, in a large population-based cohort. The study found that a faster walking pace was inversely associated with the risk of dementia, with participants showing average or brisk walking paces having a significantly lower risk. Additionally, individuals with higher handgrip strength and faster walking pace had the lowest risk of dementia. The study also highlighted the modifying effects of factors such as age and APOE Îµ4 dosage on this association. The findings suggest that assessing combined measures of physical function, genetic profile, and age could help in identifying individuals at risk of dementia.
