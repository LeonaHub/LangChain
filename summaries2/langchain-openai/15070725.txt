The text discusses the role of Arg-522 in the T7 replicative DNA helicase encoded by bacteriophage T7. The study explores the biochemical and functional implications of altering Arg-522 to alanine or lysine in the gene 4 protein. The results show that the altered proteins have decreased dTTPase activity and impaired DNA unwinding ability. The study also demonstrates that the presence of Arg-522 is crucial for coupling dTTP hydrolysis and DNA unwinding activities in the helicase. The findings suggest that Arg-522 plays a critical role in nucleotide binding, conformational changes, and translocation along ssDNA, highlighting its importance in the overall function of the gene 4 helicase.
