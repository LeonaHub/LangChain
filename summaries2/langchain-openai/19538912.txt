The text discusses a study that evaluated the effectiveness of a Student Assistance Program (UAP) with mandated college students who had alcohol-related violations. The study used a randomized clinical trial design and assessed various outcomes over a 6-month period. Results showed that students in the UAP group had reductions in weekday alcohol consumption, alcohol-related consequences, and increases in coping skills and protective behaviors compared to those in the services as usual (SAU) group. However, there were no significant differences in heavy episodic drinking or blood alcohol concentration between the two groups. The study suggests that while UAP was effective in certain areas, additional or more intensive services may be needed to address heavy drinking episodes and other alcohol-related outcomes in mandated college students. The study also highlights the importance of assessing coping skills and protective behaviors in interventions with mandated students and suggests the need for further research on the level and intensity of services required for positive changes in alcohol use behaviors.
