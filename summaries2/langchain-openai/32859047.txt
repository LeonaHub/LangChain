The study investigated the impact of heart failure on the gut-blood barrier and the levels of trimethylamine (TMA) and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) in the plasma. Spontaneously Hypertensive Heart Failure (SHHF) rats exhibited structural and functional alterations in the intestinal wall, leading to increased levels of TMA and TMAO in the plasma. The study involved metabolic and hemodynamic measurements, histopathological evaluations, ELISA tests, RNA isolation, RT-qPCR, and protein extraction for immunoblotting analysis. Results indicated that heart failure disrupted the gut-blood barrier, allowing toxic bacterial metabolites like TMA to enter the systemic circulation, potentially serving as markers and mediators of cardiovascular pathology. The study highlighted the importance of the gut-blood barrier in controlling TMA and TMAO levels in the plasma, suggesting a link between gut permeability and cardiovascular disease. The findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying elevated TMAO levels in heart failure and emphasize the need for further research in this area.
