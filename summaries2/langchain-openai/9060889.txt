The study focused on the administration of intravenous dipyridamole during exercise in patients undergoing myocardial single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to improve diagnostic accuracy. The protocol involved administering dipyridamole during exercise for patients unable to achieve a sufficient peak heart rate or oxygen consumption. Results showed that the sensitivity and negative predictive value of myocardial SPECT were significantly improved with simultaneous dipyridamole/exercise testing. The study highlighted the benefits of combining dipyridamole with exercise to enhance diagnostic yield without compromising important prognostic data obtained from maximal subjective exercise tests. The vasodilation induced by dipyridamole during exercise led to improved flow to normally perfused areas and increased myocardial activity/background activity ratio, enhancing image quality. The study suggested that systematic dipyridamole administration during exercise testing could be beneficial in patients unable to achieve adequate exercise levels, providing both clinical and ECG information while optimizing SPECT results.
