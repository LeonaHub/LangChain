The study investigated the association between two MAGE-A11 gene SNPs (rs6641352 and rs6540341) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) risk and survival. The research involved a case-control study and a cohort study with a total of 1027 cases and 1094 controls. The results indicated that both SNPs were significantly associated with an increased risk of RCC, with rs6641352 also impacting RCC survival. The study found that the CC genotype of rs6641352 was linked to a higher risk of RCC and poorer survival outcomes. In contrast, rs6540341 showed a strong association with RCC risk but not with survival. The study suggested that these intronic SNPs may play a role in RCC development, although further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms. The findings provide valuable epidemiological evidence on the relationship between MAGE-A11 SNPs and RCC in the Chinese population.
