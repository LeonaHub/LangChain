The text discusses the synthesis and characterization of stable colloidal solutions of silver sulfide quantum dots in heavy water (D2O) for the first time. The study focuses on the stability and size control of the quantum dots synthesized in heavy water compared to those in ordinary water. The synthesis process involves chemical deposition using silver nitrate, sodium sulfide, and sodium citrate as a stabilizer. Various analytical techniques such as dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and energy dispersive analysis were employed to characterize the synthesized quantum dots. The results indicate that the colloidal solutions exhibit stability and maintain small quantum dot sizes (3-19 nm) over long-term storage. The study demonstrates the potential for further research using small-angle neutron scattering to study the fine structure of silver sulfide quantum dots.
