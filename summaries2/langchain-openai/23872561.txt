The text discusses the relationship between primary and secondary metabolism in Streptomyces bacteria, focusing on the role of TAG metabolism in triggering antibiotic biosynthesis. The study analyzed the proteomes of wild-type and ppk mutant strains of S. lividans TK24, identifying proteins involved in glycolysis, lipid/fatty acid metabolism, phosphate metabolism, nitrogen and amino acid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, antibiotic biosynthesis, response to oxidative stress, iron acquisition systems, and other functions. The results suggest that the ppk mutant experiences energetic stress due to ATP deficit, leading to TAG degradation and increased antibiotic production. The study provides insights into the complex metabolic pathways involved in antibiotic biosynthesis and suggests potential strategies for discovering novel antibiotics.
