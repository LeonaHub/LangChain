The text discusses the structural and mechanistic advances in bacterial nitrate reductases, focusing on membrane-bound and periplasmic nitrate reductases. The crystallographic studies of these enzymes have revealed important details about their active sites, coordination spheres, and reaction mechanisms. The revised coordination sphere of the Mo atom in these enzymes has led to a new understanding of the reaction mechanism, involving substrate binding directly to the Mo atom and conformational rearrangements in the active site. The studies have highlighted the importance of technological advances in X-ray crystallography and protein expression systems in advancing the understanding of these enzymes. Despite the progress made, there are still challenging opportunities for future research on nitrate reductases.
