The text discusses the implementation and outcomes of a blog created by a psychiatric clinic to support patients with chronic psychiatric disorders during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown. The blog aimed to provide daily content from various therapeutic professions to help patients maintain a routine and feel connected to their healthcare providers. Despite positive feedback from patients, there were challenges in reaching the target audience and obtaining patient involvement. The blog received a moderate number of page views, but patient feedback and active participation were limited. The authors acknowledge the limitations of the project and emphasize the need for more sophisticated tools to facilitate patient involvement in psychiatric care during times of public health restrictions. The blog was seen as a valuable resource, but further development and resources are needed to enhance patient engagement and support for psychiatric patients during crises like the Covid-19 pandemic.
