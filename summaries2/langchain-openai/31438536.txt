The text describes a research study on the identification and characterization of a novel invertase inhibitor protein, Zm-INVINH4, in maize. The study investigated the gene expression, protein structure, and functional properties of Zm-INVINH4 in response to drought stress. The research involved cloning the full-length cDNA of Zm-INVINH4, expressing recombinant proteins in E. coli, and conducting functional assays to determine its inhibitory activity on invertases. The study also examined the spatial and temporal expression patterns of Zm-INVINH4 in different maize tissues under drought and ABA stress conditions. Results showed that Zm-INVINH4 specifically inhibited both cell wall and vacuolar invertases, leading to changes in sucrose accumulation in maize tissues. The study also investigated the interaction of Zm-INVINH4 with specific invertase isoforms, suggesting a role in regulating source-to-sink growth and development in maize under drought stress. Additionally, the research involved plant transformation experiments, gene expression analysis, and protein extraction and enzyme activity assays to further characterize the function of Zm-INVINH4. The study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of invertase activity in maize under drought stress conditions.
