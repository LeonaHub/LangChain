The text discusses the impact of diabetes mellitus (DM) on cardiovascular health, particularly focusing on diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) characterized by structural and functional cardiac disorders. Studies have shown that cardiomyocyte apoptosis and oxidative stress play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of DCM. Curcumin, a compound derived from turmeric, has been studied for its potential cardioprotective effects due to its antioxidant properties. In experiments with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes exposed to high glucose levels, curcumin was found to inhibit cardiomyocyte apoptosis, reduce oxidative stress, and improve cell viability. Curcumin treatment increased the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, decreased ROS generation, and suppressed NADPH oxidase activity. Additionally, curcumin activated the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3Î² signaling pathway, which is involved in cell survival and apoptosis regulation. The study suggests that curcumin may be a promising therapeutic agent for preventing diabetic cardiovascular complications, specifically DCM, by targeting oxidative stress and apoptotic pathways in cardiomyocytes.
