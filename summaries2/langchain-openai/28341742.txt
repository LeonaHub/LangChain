The text discusses experimental procedures and findings related to the entry and fusion of avian sarcoma and leukosis virus (ASLV) in different cell types. The study examines the impact of cell-extrinsic factors (such as buffer pH) and cell-intrinsic factors (like IFITM3 expression) on the acidification of endosomes and subsequent ASLV fusion. The research involves single-virus imaging assays, endosomal pH measurements using transferrin uptake experiments, and immunofluorescence assays to assess IFITM3 expression. The results indicate that cell type-specific factors influence the kinetics and efficiency of ASLV fusion, with implications for understanding viral entry mechanisms and host factors that regulate viral fusion. The study highlights the importance of controlling extracellular pH in experimental settings and provides insights into the role of IFITM3 in modulating viral fusion processes.
