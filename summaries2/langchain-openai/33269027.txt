The study focused on assessing serum total LDH levels in preeclampsia and investigating the maternal serum and cord blood LDH isoenzyme profile in preeclampsia-eclampsia. Sixty pregnant women were included, with 30 having preeclampsia and 30 as controls. The results showed a significant elevation of LDH in preeclampsia, with differences between mild and severe cases. The isoenzyme profile indicated a shift towards more anaerobic forms in preeclampsia, suggesting a link to hypoxia. LDH levels correlated with disease severity, blood pressure, and had fair specificity and sensitivity. The study suggests that LDH, along with isoenzyme distribution, could be a robust marker for hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, aiding in early risk assessment and management. Limitations included the study design and sample size, warranting further validation in larger prospective studies.
