The text discusses the global obesity epidemic and the role of the gut microbiota in relation to obesity. It highlights the complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors, including the influence of human geography, diet, physical activity, and the gut microbiome. Studies have shown differences in gut microbiota across populations, with diet and physical activity influencing microbial composition. The text suggests employing an epidemiologic model to study the associations between the gut microbiota and obesity, considering geographical diverse external environmental factors. It emphasizes the need for large, globally-distributed human microbiota studies to understand the role of the gut microbiota in the obesity epidemic.
