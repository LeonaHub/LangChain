The text discusses the role of FOXP3, a transcription factor, in regulating the immune response through the formation of a complex with histone acetyltransferase (HAT) TIP60 and histone deacetylases (HDACs) in CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells. The study explores how FOXP3 acts as an active transcriptional repressor by forming dynamic ensembles with specific HAT and HDACs. It highlights the importance of the N-terminal 106- to 190-aa region of FOXP3 in transcriptional repression and its association with TIP60, HDAC7, and HDAC9. The research demonstrates that TIP60 promotes FOXP3 acetylation, essential for transcriptional repression. Knockdown of TIP60 relieves FOXP3-mediated repression, indicating its crucial role in the complex. The study also delves into the impact of HDAC9 on FOXP3 complex dynamics and IL-2 production regulation. Overall, the findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying immune system self-regulation and the potential for pharmaceutical interventions targeting HATs and HDACs to modulate regulatory T cell functions.
