The text discusses the impact of aging on neuronal properties and synaptic function in Aplysia, a marine snail. Aging leads to a decline in neuronal excitability and synaptic strength, resulting in sensory, motor deficits, and memory loss. The study focuses on the effects of aging on tail sensory neurons (SN) and their response to L-glutamate (L-Glu) and serotonin (5-HT) in the context of the tail withdrawal reflex (TWR) in Aplysia. The research shows that aging impairs 5-HT-induced facilitation of L-Glu currents in aged SN but can be rescued by activators of protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathways. These findings suggest that deficiencies in 5-HT receptor physiology and second messenger-dependent signaling contribute to age-related learning impairments in Aplysia. The study also highlights the role of ionotropic glutamate
