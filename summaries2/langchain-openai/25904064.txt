The text discusses the application of Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI IMS) for visualizing biomolecules in tissue. It highlights the challenges in protein identification in IMS experiments and the three general identification strategies: bottom-up, top-down, and indirect identification. The focus is on the use of MALDI FTICR MS for protein imaging, providing high mass resolution and accuracy for identifying intact proteins in tissue samples. A case study involving the identification of modified forms of S100A8 in kidney tissue from a mouse infected with Staphylococcus aureus is presented, demonstrating the ability of MALDI FTICR IMS to provide detailed molecular information in infectious foci. The study showcases the importance of high-resolution IMS technologies in advancing our understanding of protein modifications and their biological implications in infection biology.
