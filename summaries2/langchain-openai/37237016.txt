The text discusses the magneto-strain effect in 2D magnetic material CrGeTe3, highlighting its potential applications in spintronics, straintronics, sensors, actuators, and transducers. The magneto-strain effect is associated with changes in the physical dimensions due to magnetic ordering, leading to coupling of elastic, electric, magnetic, and thermal fields. The 2D nature of CrGeTe3 results in in-plane and out-of-plane strain, impacting its magnetic and electronic properties. The FM ordering in CrGeTe3 is influenced by factors such as layer thickness, magnetic field, electric field, and strain. The text also delves into the experimental and theoretical investigations of the magneto-strain effects in CrGeTe3, including XRD patterns, magnetization studies, band structure analysis, ARPES results, XPS, and XANES measurements. The magneto-strain effects are attributed to changes in the crystal structure, leading to shifts in electronic bands, band broadening, and twinned bands. The interplay between in-plane Ueff and out-of-plane SOC governs the 2D ferromagnetism in CrGeTe3, making it a promising candidate for strain engineering and spintronic applications.
