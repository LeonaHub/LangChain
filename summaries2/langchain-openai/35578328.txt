The text discusses the importance of peer-led interventions in schools and the selection of peer leaders to optimize the effectiveness of these interventions. It highlights the use of network information to inform the selection of influential and representative peer leaders. The study examines various theoretical selection methods, such as Peer Opinion Leaders (POL), Friendship Network Opinion Leaders (FNOL), Key Players (KPL), and Hybrid Methods (HPL), to identify peer leaders in a suicide prevention program. The results show that network-informed selection methods produce peer leaders with higher sociometric characteristics, better clustering, and closer proximity to at-risk students compared to adult-selected peer leaders. The study also explores the relationship between selection concordance and intervention diffusion, indicating that concordance with respected opinion leaders and key players is associated with increased exposure to intervention modalities. The findings suggest that a hybrid approach combining respected opinion leaders and strategically placed key players may offer the best potential for intervention diffusion in schools.
