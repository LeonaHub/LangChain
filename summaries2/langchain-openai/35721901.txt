The text discusses the synthesis and characterization of a luminescent molybdenum cluster, [Mo6Cl14]2–, and its potential application for sensing nitroaromatic compounds, specifically trinitrotoluene (TNT). Experimental and computational studies were conducted to evaluate the cluster's photophysical properties and its interaction with TNT. The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of the molybdenum cluster showed maximum absorption at 330 nm, consistent with similar clusters. The study focused on the quenching of the cluster's fluorescence by TNT, with Stern-Volmer analysis indicating significant quenching at concentrations above 4 × 10–5 mM. Theoretical calculations revealed the involvement of TNT in the cluster's electronic transitions, leading to quenching of luminescence. The results suggest that the molybdenum cluster has potential as a fluorescence-based sensor for detecting nitroaromatic explosives, although further studies on selectivity are needed for real-world applications.
