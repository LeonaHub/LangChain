The study focused on investigating the potential role of LTBP2 gene mutations in primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) by screening 55 patients with PACG and one with pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PEX) accompanied by angle closure glaucoma. A total of 24 sequence variations were identified, with two coding mutations, p. Gln1417Arg and p. Gly1660Trp, being considered as potentially contributing to PACG. These mutations were absent in control individuals, predicted to affect protein function, and observed in patients with PACG. The study suggests that LTBP2 mutations may play a role in the development of PACG, highlighting the need for further research in larger patient cohorts to better understand the genetic basis of the disease.
