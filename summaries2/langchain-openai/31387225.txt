The study focused on optimizing the extraction of fucose, total glucans, and antioxidant activities from brown macroalgae using hydrothermal-assisted extraction (HAE) and sequential ultrasound and thermal technologies. Response surface methodology was employed to determine the optimal extraction conditions for Laminaria hyperborea, which were then applied to Laminaria digitata and Ascophyllum nodosum. The results showed varying yields of fucose and total glucans among the different macroalgae species. The study highlighted the importance of implementing different extraction approaches for recovering fucose and total glucans separately. Further research is needed to purify and characterize the extracted polysaccharides for potential biorefinery applications.
