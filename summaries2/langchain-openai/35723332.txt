The text describes a study conducted to investigate the mechanism of resistance of the pecan scab pathogen, Venturia effusa, to the demethylation-inhibiting (DMI) fungicide tebuconazole. The study involved field sensitivity evaluations of V. effusa to DMI fungicides, in vitro sensitivity assays, and the determination of the resistance mechanism through DNA sequencing and gene expression analysis. The study identified mutations in the CYP51A and CYP51B genes, as well as increased gene expression levels in resistant isolates. The research methodology included DNA extraction, PCR amplification, sequencing, and gene expression analysis. The data analysis involved statistical methods to assess the efficacy of DMI fungicides in the field and gene expression levels in resistant isolates. The study provides insights into the resistance mechanisms of V. effusa to tebuconazole and highlights the importance of further research for effective and sustainable management of pecan scab.
