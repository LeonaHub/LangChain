The text discusses the identification of specific peptide biomarkers in soft-shelled turtle gelatin (STG) using PTM detection-based peptidomics analysis. Collagen, the main component of STG, was analyzed to identify STG-specific peptides. Through a screening process, 16 specific peptide sequences were identified, with 8 peptides showing consistent detection in STG samples. These peptides were further analyzed for various PTM types, including hydroxylation and deamidation. Among 74 peptides with different PTMs, 8 peptides with the highest signal intensity were selected as STG-specific peptide biomarkers. These biomarkers were synthesized and verified using UPLC-MS/MS, confirming their exclusivity to STG samples. The study demonstrates a method for authenticating STG and ensuring product quality and safety through the identification of specific peptide biomarkers.
