The study aimed to develop a new pulp capping material by incorporating bismuth oxide and calcium hydroxide into Portland cement. The physical properties of the new material were evaluated, including setting time, compressive strength, diametral tensile strength, and push out bond strength. Results showed that the addition of bismuth oxide and calcium hydroxide affected the setting time, compressive strength, and push out bond strength of the material. The new material exhibited acceptable physical and adhesive properties when 10 wt% calcium hydroxide was added to Portland cement. Overall, the study suggests that this modified Portland cement could serve as a potential alternative to mineral trioxide aggregate for pulp capping procedures.
