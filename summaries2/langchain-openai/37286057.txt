The text discusses a study that aimed to evaluate the impact of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) on postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The study analyzed data from patients who underwent primary TKA between 2011 and 2021, differentiating CVI severity into simple, complex, and unclassified categories. Results showed that while patients with complex CVI had a higher risk of post-TKA complications compared to those with simple CVI, overall CVI did not significantly affect composite complications, short-term or long-term complications, revisions, or readmissions. The study also highlighted the influence of factors such as insurance status, surgery year, age, race, smoking, and comorbidity index on complication rates. The findings suggest that stratifying CVI severity could help predict post-TKA complication rates, and improvements in surgical care over time may have contributed to decreased complication rates in recent years. Further research is recommended to better understand the relationship between CVI and TKA outcomes.
