The text discusses a study on the evaluation of the treatment effect and prognostic utility of FDG PET/CT parameters in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients who underwent neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) followed by surgery. The study aimed to confirm the usefulness of the Positron Emission Tomography Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (PERCIST) for evaluating treatment effect based on pathological treatment response (PTR) and analyze the prognostic utility of FDG PET/CT parameters. The study included 22 PDAC patients who underwent PET/CT before and after NAT. The results showed that PERCIST and SUVmax were superior to RECIST for determining the therapeutic effect, with the metabolic tumor volume (MTV) reduction rate being an independent prognostic factor for recurrence and survival. The study highlights the importance of PET/CT parameters in predicting treatment response and prognosis in PDAC patients undergoing NAT followed by surgery.
