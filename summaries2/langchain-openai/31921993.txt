The text discusses the development and implementation of a film-based curriculum aimed at addressing mistreatment in the medical student learning environment from the perspectives of faculty, residents, nurses, and staff. The curriculum includes film screenings, slide deck presentations, and facilitated discussions to explore challenges and promote understanding among stakeholders. Evaluation data shows positive responses from students and educators, with many feeling better equipped to address challenges and reporting increased understanding of differing perspectives. The curriculum aims to foster intergenerational dialogue and shared responsibility for creating a positive learning environment. While the curriculum has been positively received, further research is needed to assess its long-term impact. The text also acknowledges the need to include patient and family perspectives in future projects to enhance patient-centered care.
