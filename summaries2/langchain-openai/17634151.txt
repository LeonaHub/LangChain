The text discusses the biases in tree reconciliation methods used to study gene gain and loss in evolutionary genomics. These biases lead to overestimation of duplications near the root of the species tree and an overestimation of losses across the tree. The study demonstrates how decreasing bootstrap cut-offs result in increased errors in the number of inferred gains and losses. The biases affect previous studies on vertebrate genome evolution, potentially leading to incorrect inferences. The text suggests improvements in reconciliation methods and highlights the challenges in accurately studying gene gain and loss in evolutionary genomics.
