The text discusses the biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (SNPs) using Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as a model system. The study explores the involvement of various cellular proteins, including histone (H4), carbonic anhydrase, ferredoxin, superoxide dismutase, and others, in the biosynthesis and capping of SNPs. Protein depletion experiments confirm the direct control of protein content on the size and synthesis rate of SNPs. SDS-PAGE gel analysis and proteomics were used to identify SNPs-associated proteins. The study also includes spectroscopic and kinetic characterization of SNPs, as well as electron microscopic characterization using SEM and TEM techniques. Additionally, the cellular localization of in vivo synthesized SNPs within C. reinhardtii cells was explored using fixation, embedding, and TEM imaging.
