The text discusses a study on transgenerational gene expression patterns in chickens, focusing on the brain and liver at embryonic day 12. The study aimed to understand the molecular basis of heterosis, particularly in relation to gene expression. The research found that additivity was the predominant gene expression pattern, with dominance and over-dominance also observed. Phenotypic data indicated a heterosis effect in embryo weight. The DE genes between parental lines and crosses were enriched in functions related to tissue development, immunity, and metabolism. Most DE genes did not show allelic imbalance in gene expression, suggesting that trans-acting mechanisms may be the primary regulatory mechanisms underlying differential gene expression and heterosis in the F1 cross. The study highlights the importance of considering tissue-specific gene expression and developmental stages in understanding heterosis in chickens.
