The text discusses the correlation between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and fragility fractures in elderly patients, particularly those over 60 years old. A systematic review was conducted, including various studies that assessed the association between T2DM and fragility fractures, such as hip, vertebral, and non-vertebral fractures. The majority of studies indicated that elderly patients with T2DM are at an increased risk of fragility fractures, especially hip fractures. However, there was some controversy regarding non-vertebral fractures, with conflicting results in different studies. Various factors contribute to bone fragility in T2DM patients, including hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, and impaired bone turnover. The text also highlights the impact of pharmacological treatments for T2DM on bone health and fracture risk. Clinicians are advised to consider specific fracture risk factors in T2DM patients and tailor treatment approaches accordingly, including bone mineral density assessments, fracture risk calculations, and osteoporosis treatments. Overall, the text emphasizes the importance of recognizing bone fragility as a complication of T2DM, particularly in elderly patients, and the need for further research and tailored management strategies for this vulnerable population.
