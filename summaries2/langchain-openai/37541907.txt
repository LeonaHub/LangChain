The text discusses a systematic review (SR) conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of lifestyle modifications and nonpharmacologic interventions in improving outcomes for patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The review aimed to identify evidence supporting healthy lifestyle changes and psychological interventions for PsA. The SR included studies on physical activity, diet, smoking cessation, mud bath therapy, and other interventions. However, the review found limited high-quality evidence to recommend these interventions for PsA management. The studies included in the review showed some positive effects on functional capacity, disease activity, and quality of life, but the overall evidence was limited and of low quality. The review highlighted the need for further research to determine the impact of lifestyle modifications on PsA outcomes and emphasized the importance of evidence-based interventions in PsA care.
