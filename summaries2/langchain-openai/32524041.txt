The text discusses a study conducted on patients with drug-resistant epilepsy who were implanted with the RNS System, a neurostimulation device, to examine its effects on sleep. The study aimed to determine whether brain-responsive neurostimulation disrupts sleep by analyzing the relationship between stimulations, arousals, and epileptiform activity. Polysomnography recordings were conducted on six subjects, and the results showed that RNS System stimulations did not cause arousals. Instead, the arousals tended to peak before the stimulations, suggesting that epileptiform activity may cause both arousals and stimulations with variable latencies. The study had limitations, including a small sample size and the complexity of interpreting the relationship between stimulations and arousals triggered by epileptiform activity. The findings suggest that RNS System stimulation does not disrupt sleep acutely, but further research is needed to understand the long-term effects and potential variations based on lead placements and stimulation targets.
