The study investigated the role of P2X receptors and Î±-adrenoceptors in mediating sympathetic control of arterial tone in rat mesenteric arteries of different sizes. The research found that the purinergic component dominated in small-medium arteries, while large arteries were primarily adrenergic. The study showed that calcium influx through P2X receptor channels was sufficient for contraction, with minimal contribution from L-type calcium channels or calcium-induced calcium release. The findings suggest that P2X receptors play a significant role in small-medium arteries and may be potential targets for hypertension treatment.
