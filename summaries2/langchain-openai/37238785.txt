The text discusses the analysis of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) such as Nε-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML) and Nε-(carboxyethyl)lysine (CEL), as well as acrylamide in plant-based meat analogs (PBMA). The study investigated the contents of CML, CEL, and acrylamide in 15 commercially sold PBMA, along with factors influencing their formation such as protein, amino acids, sugars, and fatty acids. Results showed varying levels of CML, CEL, and acrylamide in PBMA, with correlations found between these compounds and certain ingredients. The study also highlighted the importance of considering ingredient composition and processing methods to reduce the formation of harmful compounds in PBMA. Further research will focus on understanding the mechanisms and strategies to minimize the formation of CML, CEL, and acrylamide in PBMA.
