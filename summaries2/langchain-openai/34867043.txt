The text discusses a study on the chemopreventive effects of metformin (MET) in an in vivo rat model of breast carcinogenesis induced by DMBA and TCDD, which are known AhR activators. The study aimed to explore the role of the AhR/CYP1 pathway in breast cancer initiation and the potential protective effects of MET. The results showed that MET treatment inhibited AhR activation, reduced the expression of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1, induced apoptosis through caspase-3 and BAX, upregulated FoxO3a, inhibited oxidative DNA damage genes, and arrested cell cycle proliferation by downregulating cyclin D1. Additionally, MET blocked mammosphere formation in MCF-7 cells, indicating a reduction in breast cancer stem cells. The study suggests that MET exerts its chemopreventive effects by targeting the AhR/CYP1 pathway and inhibiting breast cancer initiation. However, further studies measuring enzymatic activities are needed to validate these findings.
