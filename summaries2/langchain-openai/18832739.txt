The text discusses the role of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in tumor-associated immune suppression and their potential subsets in cancer. The study used ten different tumor models on three mouse strains to investigate the expansion of MDSC and their subsets. It was found that the granulocytic subset of MDSC was predominantly expanded in most tumor models, while the monocytic subset was increased in specific models. Both subsets employed different mechanisms of T-cell suppression, with granulocytic MDSC producing high levels of ROS and low levels of NO, and monocytic MDSC showing the opposite. Despite these differences, both subsets equally suppressed antigen-specific T-cell function. The study also explored the role of surface molecules such as PD-L1, PD-L2, CD80, CD115, and CD124 in MDSC-mediated immune suppression, finding no preferential accumulation of cells expressing these molecules in tumor models. The data suggest that the immune suppressive activity of MDSC in cancer may not be attributed to specific subsets but rather to the entire population of these cells.
