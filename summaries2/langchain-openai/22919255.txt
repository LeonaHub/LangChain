The text discusses a systematic review and meta-analysis conducted to investigate the association between XRCC1 gene polymorphisms and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The study focused on three specific XRCC1 polymorphisms (Arg194Trp, Arg280His, and Arg399Gln) and their potential impact on HCC risk. The analysis included data from multiple studies involving different ethnic populations. Results indicated that the Arg194Trp and Arg399Gln polymorphisms were not associated with HCC risk, while the association between the Arg280His polymorphism and HCC risk was inconclusive. The study highlighted the need for further research with larger sample sizes and diverse populations to better understand the role of XRCC1 gene polymorphisms in HCC susceptibility.
