The text discusses the neurological manifestations of Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection, focusing on cases of neuralgic amyotrophy/plexus neuritis and encephalitis. The study evaluated patients with neurological diseases over a 7.5-year period, identifying five cases of extrahepatic neurological manifestations of acute HEV infection. The patients presented with symptoms such as plexus neuritis, encephalitis, and weakness in the upper extremities. Elevated anti-HEV-IgM and anti-HEV-IgG serum levels were observed in some cases, suggesting a possible causal relationship between HEV infection and neurological symptoms. The study highlights the importance of considering HEV in unusual neurological cases and the need for further research to understand the pathomechanisms and treatment strategies for HEV-associated neurological manifestations.
