The paper discusses the Complexity Account of Treatment Efficacy (CATE) in the context of treating lexical semantic deficits in individuals with fluent aphasia. It explores the concept of semantic complexity within the organization of semantic categories, focusing on typical and atypical examples within categories. The paper proposes a complexity hierarchy based on item typicality, suggesting that atypical examples are more complex than typical examples due to their core, distinctive, and prototypical features. The study examines the effects of treatment that progresses from complex to simple category items compared to the reverse. Results show that training atypical items leads to generalization to typical items, while training typical items does not influence production of atypical items. Factors influencing treatment success include patient variables, stimulus/task-specific variables, and treatment protocol. The paper also discusses the clinical relevance of generalization to untrained items and the implications of the complexity hierarchy for treatment of naming deficits in aphasia. Further research is recommended to explore other indices of semantic complexity and their impact on language recovery in individuals with aphasia.
