The text discusses the importance of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) in diagnosing prostate cancer (PCa) and assessing locoregional staging. The study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of PI-RADS v2.1 features in predicting extraprostatic extension (EPE) of PCa and develop a comprehensive mEPE-score. The mEPE-score combines all PI-RADS v2.1 parameters for assessing pEPE and showed excellent diagnostic performance. The study found that individual mEPE features have low sensitivity and high specificity, but the mEPE-score provided consistent and reliable assessment for pEPE. The study suggests that using a score for evaluating mEPE is critical for obtaining reliable results in mpMRI assessments of PCa.
