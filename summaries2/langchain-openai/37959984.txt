The study focused on the long-term outcomes of polymeric vascular grafts made of poly-Îµ-caprolactone (PCL) in a rat abdominal aorta model after 180 days of implantation. The research identified three main histological reactions observed in the grafts: encapsulation, chronic inflammation, and scaffold degradation with remodeling and vitalization. Intimal hyperplasia and subintimal mineralization were common in all implants. While no graft ossification was found, the presence of S 100 positive cells with signs of chondroid metaplasia was noted in neointima layers. The study highlighted the importance of understanding cell differentiation in the remodeling of artificial vascular prostheses and the need for further research to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of these processes.
