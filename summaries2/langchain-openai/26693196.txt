The study aimed to assess the awareness and knowledge of glaucoma in patients aged 40 years and above at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Ghana. The study found that 74% of participants were aware of glaucoma, with higher education levels being associated with increased awareness. However, despite high awareness, knowledge about glaucoma was low, with many participants having misconceptions about its clinical presentation. The study highlighted the need for increased awareness programs with a focus on educating patients, especially those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, to promote early detection and treatment of glaucoma. The study also emphasized the importance of community-based studies to further evaluate awareness and knowledge levels of glaucoma in the general population.
