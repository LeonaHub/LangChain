The text discusses a study on phenylketonuria (PKU) in a Chinese population, focusing on genotype-phenotype correlations in patients with PKU. The study analyzed 1104 patients with PKU, identifying 203 mutations in the PAH gene. The study classified patients into different phenotypes based on plasma phenylalanine levels and analyzed genotype-phenotype correlations. The study found correlations between specific mutations and PKU phenotypes, with some mutations associated with classic PKU, mild PKU, or mild hyperphenylalaninaemia. The study also highlighted inconsistencies between genotype and phenotype, suggesting the need for further research to understand these discrepancies. The methods included sequencing the PAH gene, predicting residual PAH activity for each mutation, and categorizing genotypes based on predicted activity levels.
