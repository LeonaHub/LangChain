The study investigated the impact of asthma on Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) expression in peripheral blood and sputum leukocytes. It was found that asthmatics had lower levels of soluble TLR2 (sTLR2) in both serum and sputum compared to healthy subjects. Additionally, TLR2 mRNA expression in sputum leukocytes was significantly lower in asthmatics. The decrease in TLR2 expression in asthmatics may be influenced by the cytokine milieu in the lung, particularly Th2-related and inflammatory cytokines. The study suggests that sTLR2 levels could serve as a potential marker for asthma severity, although further research is needed to understand the relationship between sTLR2 and asthma progression.
