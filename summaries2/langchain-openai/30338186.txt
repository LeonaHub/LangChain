The text discusses the clinical application of the IllumiScan, a fluorescence visualization device, in detecting oral mucosal lesions such as oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and leukoplakia. The study compared the IllumiScan with other screening methods like VELscope and narrow band imaging (NBI). Results showed that the IllumiScan was effective in distinguishing between cancer and normal areas, with high sensitivity and specificity for OSCC and leukoplakia. However, distinguishing between normal areas and leukoplakia was more challenging due to the keratinized layer of leukoplakia. The study suggests that combining the IllumiScan with other screening methods could improve diagnostic accuracy for oral mucosal lesions.
