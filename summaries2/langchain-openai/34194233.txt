The text discusses the issue of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and the challenges it poses in healthcare settings, particularly focusing on the ESKAPE pathogens group. The study conducted in an infectious diseases hospital in Romania from 2016 to 2020 analyzed the evolution of AMR, with a particular emphasis on MRSA, ESBL, and MDR rates. The study found that ESKAPE pathogens were the most commonly isolated bacteria, with consistent resistance profiles over the years, although increasing trends in MRSA, ESBL, and MDR rates were observed. The study highlighted the need for improved microbiological diagnosis methods, alignment with European antimicrobial susceptibility testing standards, and enhanced clinical vigilance for infectious diseases to combat AMR effectively. The challenges faced by the Romanian healthcare system in managing AMR, including resource limitations and uneven distribution of healthcare resources, were also discussed. The study concluded that recognizing and addressing AMR is crucial for updating antibiotic prescription protocols and improving AMR control practices.
