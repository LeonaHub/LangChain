The text discusses the investigation of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility in various animal species using primary cell culture models. The study examined the mRNA expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL in the respiratory tracts of different mammals and analyzed viral replication in primary cell cultures derived from dogs, hamsters, ferrets, and ungulates. Results showed efficient viral replication in dog-derived cultures, while hamsters and ferrets exhibited varied susceptibility. The study also highlighted the importance of alternative receptors for viral entry and the potential limitations of cell culture models in replicating in vivo infection patterns. Overall, the research underscores the need for further studies to identify potential intermediate hosts and reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 while minimizing the use of animal experiments.
