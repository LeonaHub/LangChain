The study evaluated the selectivity of water buffaloes for four tree species commonly used in silvopastoral systems: Leucaena leucocephala, Albizia lebbeck, Gliricidia sepium, and Moringa oleifera. The research found that A. lebbeck and L. leucocephala were the most consumed leaves, while G. sepium and M. oleifera were consumed in lower quantities. A. lebbeck contributed more nutritionally to the animals, despite equal consumption levels with L. leucocephala. The study provides insights into buffaloes' preferences for different leaves and suggests further exploration of the effects of secondary metabolites on feed intake in future studies.
