The study investigated the association between COVID-19 and the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients undergoing diagnostic testing for VTE in a healthcare system in Sweden during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic. The retrospective observational study included a cohort of patients who underwent VTE testing in 2020 and compared them with patients from 2015 to 2019. The results showed no increase in the prevalence of VTE in 2020 compared to previous years, and there was no significant difference in VTE prevalence between patients who were SARS-CoV-2 positive, negative, or untested in 2020. The study found that COVID-19 infection did not increase the odds for VTE when adjusting for known risk factors and ongoing anticoagulation treatment. The prevalence of VTE was lower in non-ICU COVID-19 patients compared to those without COVID-19, but higher in ICU patients with confirmed COVID-19. The study concluded that COVID-19 status should not significantly influence the pretest probability for VTE in patients undergoing diagnostic testing, and further research is needed to confirm these findings.
