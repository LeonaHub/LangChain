The text discusses the role of the adiponectin system in regulating reproductive functions in females. Adiponectin, an adipocyte-derived hormone, is involved in various processes in the reproductive system, including the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovarian axis, uterus, embryos, and placenta. Adiponectin and its receptors are expressed in these structures, influencing steroidogenesis, prostaglandin synthesis, and cell proliferation. The hormone plays a crucial role in oocyte maturation, embryo development, and trophoblast invasion. Adiponectin's effects are dependent on the hormonal status of the individual, impacting energy metabolism and reproductive processes during the menstrual/oestrous cycle and pregnancy. Overall, adiponectin acts as an important hormonal regulator in the female reproductive tract, modulating various physiological processes crucial for reproductive success.
