The text discusses the risk assessment framework for Pine Wilt Disease (PWD) caused by the Pine Wood Nematode (PWN) in China. The study integrates network analysis, Species Distribution Models (SDMs), and niche concepts to assess the introduction, establishment, and dispersal risks of PWN. Multiple introduction pathways for PWN in China were identified, with primary source countries and entry ports. The areas of PWN overlap with its hosts and insect vectors were analyzed, showing distributions in southern, central, and northeastern China. Climate change is projected to increase the threat of PWN to hosts and enhance the dispersal capacity of its insect vectors. The study provides insights for evaluating and mitigating the risks associated with PWN establishment and dispersal in China, offering a comprehensive risk assessment framework for Invasive Alien Species (IAS).
