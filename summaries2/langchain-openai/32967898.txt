The text discusses the use of Virena software and Sofia influenza A+B FIA for tracking influenza cases in outpatient clinics across the Los Angeles area. The study aimed to predict influenza activity in the emergency department (ED) by analyzing data from outpatient clinics. Results showed that increases in positive influenza cases in the outpatient setting preceded an influx of cases in the ED, providing a potential early warning sign. The study highlights the importance of rapid influenza testing for timely infection prevention and treatment, as well as the potential for using outpatient data to predict ED surges. Limitations include the lack of demographic information and the need for ongoing evaluation and adjustment of the algorithm. Future directions include expanding the use of POCTs for other respiratory viruses like RSV. The findings suggest that outpatient influenza data can be valuable for monitoring ED and inpatient influenza activity and guiding decision-making processes at hospitals.
