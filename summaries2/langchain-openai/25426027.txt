The text describes the development of a chronic cranial window with an access port using a silicone plug, allowing for repeated injections, functional imaging, and electrophysiological recordings in the brain of mice. The device simplifies surgical procedures, maintains imaging quality, and enables easy access to the brain for various manipulations. The method was successfully used for repeated dye injections and electrophysiological recordings, demonstrating its utility for long-term in vivo studies. The device offers biocompatibility, stability, and sterile conditions, reducing the need for multiple animals in research and enabling new experiments in neuroscience.
