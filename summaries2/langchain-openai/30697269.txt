The text discusses the role of miR-210 and PTPN2 in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia (PE). It highlights that miR-210 expression is induced under hypoxia, promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, potentially contributing to PE development. PTPN2, a target of miR-210, is shown to inhibit these behaviors in JAR cells. The study suggests that miR-210 and PTPN2 could serve as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for PE. The PDGFR-Akt signaling pathway is implicated in the regulation of PE development by miR-210-PTPN2. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms involved.
