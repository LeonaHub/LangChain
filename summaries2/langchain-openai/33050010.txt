The study focused on evaluating the prognostic role of various bladder cancer markers, including survivin, CD68, CLEVER-1, MAC387, KRT5, KRT20, ERBB2, and BIRC5, in MIBC patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. The research involved analyzing protein markers through immunohistochemistry and mRNA markers through RT-qPCR. The study cohort consisted of 50 MIBC patients, and the analysis revealed associations between marker expression levels, macrophage infiltration, and patient outcomes. High levels of survivin and BIRC5 were linked to better survival, while macrophage infiltration was associated with worse outcomes, particularly in tumors with high proliferative activity or elevated ERBB2 expression. The study highlighted the potential of these markers in predicting chemotherapy benefit and the importance of considering immune cell infiltration in treatment strategies. The findings suggest that a combination of immunohistochemical and molecular methods could aid in predicting patient outcomes and guiding therapeutic interventions in bladder cancer. Further prospective studies with larger patient cohorts are recommended to validate these findings.
