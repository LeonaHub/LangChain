The text discusses the prevalence and impact of postnatal depression (PND) on mother-infant relationships, emphasizing the importance of early intervention to prevent long-term consequences on infant development. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) is proposed to evaluate the effectiveness of a brief, four-session intervention called HUGS (Happiness, Understanding, Giving and Sharing) in enhancing mother-infant relationships following PND treatment. The study aims to assess the quality of mother-infant interactions, maternal parenting stress, infant behavior, and developmental milestones. The HUGS program is designed to be cost-effective, easily implemented, and integrated into existing PND treatment pathways, with the goal of preventing the intergenerational transmission of risk and promoting long-term health outcomes.
