The article discusses the isolation and characterization of two specialized metabolites, truncatenolide and truncatenone, from the culture filtrates of the soybean pathogen Colletotrichum truncatum in Argentina. Truncatenolide exhibited phytotoxic and antifungal activity against soybean pathogens M. phaseolina and C. nicotianae. Truncatenone stimulated seed root growth. A structure-activity relationship study compared these compounds with known nonenolides, showing truncatenolide's strong antifungal activity against C. nicotianae and M. phaseolina. Modiolide A and pinolidoxin also displayed significant antifungal activity against C. nicotianae. Further research is needed to explore the potential fungicidal properties of these compounds.
