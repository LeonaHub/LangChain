The text discusses a case report of a 47-year-old Japanese woman with Lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI), a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by SLC7A7 gene variants. The patient presented with renal tubular acidosis (RTA)/Fanconi syndrome and rickets in childhood, with subsequent complications including autoimmune hemolytic anemia, epilepsy, and kidney dysfunction. Genetic analysis confirmed a homozygous nonsense variant of SLC7A7. Pathological findings revealed renal tubular abnormalities characterized by PAS-positive granules and large vacuoles. The study highlights the importance of considering LPI in patients with renal tubular diseases, even in the absence of typical LPI symptoms, and the role of comprehensive genetic analysis in diagnosing such cases. The authors declare no conflicts of interest, and the study was conducted in accordance with ethical standards and informed consent protocols.
