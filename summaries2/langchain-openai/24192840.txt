The text discusses tandem repeats (TRs) in DNA sequences, which are motifs with adjacent repeating units found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. TRs are categorized into microsatellites (1-6 bp) and minisatellites (10-100 bp). Studies have shown that TR densities do not correlate with genome size in plants and animals. TRs are mutable and can cause genetic diseases. TRs are nonrandomly distributed in genomes, with higher densities in genes involved in transcriptional regulation. TR motifs are influenced by GC content, with GC-rich motifs preferred in regions with high GC content. TR densities vary in different intragenic and intergenic regions, with 5'-UTRs having the highest densities. TR motifs are biased towards gene ends in intergenic regions and introns. The study analyzed TR distributions in different plant and green algal species, highlighting the need for further research to understand the evolutionary trends and biological functions of TRs in these organisms.
