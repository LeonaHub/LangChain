The text discusses the characterization of Vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1) and its paralog VKORC1L1, focusing on their membrane topology, enzymatic activity, and active site regeneration mechanisms. VKORC1 is a three-TMD membrane protein responsible for reducing vitamin K epoxide, while VKORC1L1 is a four-TMD protein with conserved loop cysteines in the ER lumen. VKORC1L1 efficiently supports vitamin K-dependent carboxylation and requires its loop cysteines for active site regeneration through an intra-molecular pathway. The study suggests that VKORC1L1 and VKORC1 have different structures and reaction mechanisms, potentially indicating distinct physiological functions.
