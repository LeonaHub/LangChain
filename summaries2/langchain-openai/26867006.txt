The text discusses the impact of diameter distribution on charge transport in polydisperse semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) networks. It highlights the use of near-infrared electroluminescence as a sensitive measure to quantify the distribution of carriers within mixed nanotube networks. The study reveals that the transport paths in SWNT networks are non-uniform and strongly influenced by the energy level distribution of the nanotubes. The presence of small bandgap nanotubes leads to preferential transport through them, even if they are a minority within the network, rendering other nanotubes less effective. The findings suggest that narrow diameter distributions are more suitable for achieving maximum on-currents in field-effect transistors (FETs) with a given network density. The study emphasizes the importance of understanding and designing SWNT networks to optimize device performance while minimizing purification costs.
