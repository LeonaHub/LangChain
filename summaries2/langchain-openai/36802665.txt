The text discusses the discovery and optimization of a highly potent and selective inhibitor, BAY-805 (compound 21), targeting the deubiquitinating enzyme USP21. The compound was developed through a screening process of the Bayer compound library, followed by hit-to-lead optimization steps. Compound 21 demonstrated low nanomolar potency in biochemical and cellular assays, showing high selectivity against USP21 and various off-targets. The compound was found to inhibit USP21 activity, leading to NF-ÎºB pathway activation. The synthesis of BAY-805 was achieved through a straightforward and efficient four-step process. The study highlights the importance of BAY-805 as a chemical probe for investigating the role of USP21 in various physiological and disease processes, including viral infections and cancers. Additionally, the availability of the less active enantiomer, BAY-728 (compound 22), provides a valuable negative control for further research. Both compounds will be accessible for use in cellular studies upon request.
