The text discusses a study on patients with dominantly inherited retinitis pigmentosa caused by mutations in the rhodopsin gene. The study compared rates of disease progression based on longitudinal follow-up examinations of patients with different mutations in the rhodopsin gene. The study found that disease severity varied based on the region of the rhodopsin molecule affected by the mutation, with patients with mutations affecting the C terminus region showing more rapid disease progression. The study also highlighted the importance of longitudinal studies in accurately measuring disease progression in individual patients, as cross-sectional data may be influenced by ascertainment biases. The study identified factors beyond the gene defect itself, such as modifier genes, diet, general health, or light exposure, that may affect the clinical course of the condition. The study was supported by grants from the National Eye Institute and the Foundation Fighting Blindness. The findings suggest that patients with rhodopsin mutations lose visual acuity at a rate similar to other patients with retinitis pigmentosa but lose peripheral retinal function more slowly. The study also discusses the structure of rhodopsin, the impact of mutations on disease progression, and the variation in disease course among patients with mutations affecting the same region of the rhodopsin molecule.
