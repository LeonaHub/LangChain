The text discusses a systematic review that aimed to update evidence on the effects of supplementing infant formula with Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 (B lactis) and/or Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) on the growth of healthy infants. The review included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing weight gain, length gain, head circumference gain, and BMI in infants fed formula with probiotic supplementation compared to those fed unsupplemented formula. The findings suggest that B lactis supplementation did not significantly impact growth parameters, while limited data on LGG showed potential for improved growth. However, caution is advised due to methodological limitations, small sample sizes, and short follow-up periods in the included studies. The review also highlights the importance of adequate statistical power, longer study durations, and consideration of protein content in infant formula for future research on probiotic supplementation and infant growth.
