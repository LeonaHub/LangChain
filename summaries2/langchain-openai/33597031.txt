The study focuses on the 5-year outcomes of endoscopic nasopharyngectomy for recurrent, localized nasopharyngeal carcinoma (rNPC) in North America. Thirteen patients were followed up, showing an 84.6% 5-year overall survival rate with favorable complication rates. Lower rStages correlated with higher disease-free rates, and early cStages were associated with better overall prognosis. The study highlights the importance of close surveillance and prompt management of recurrences for long-term tumor control in patients undergoing endoscopic nasopharyngectomy.
