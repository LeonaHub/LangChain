The text discusses a study conducted on the clinical acceptability of crowns in dental practices, focusing on remake rates and associated factors. The study involved 205 dentists who prepared teeth for crowns, with 3.8% of crowns being rejected at the try-in appointment. Reasons for rejection included proximal misfit and esthetic failures, with suspected laboratory errors being a common cause. Dentists with fewer years of experience and busier practices tended to have higher remake rates. Patient characteristics showed that those receiving crowns were well-educated and tended to be from more affluent areas. The study highlighted the subjective nature of clinical acceptability and potential biases. Overall, the remake rate for single-unit crowns was 3.8%, with associations found between remake rates, crown fit evaluations, and various dentist, practice, and patient characteristics.
