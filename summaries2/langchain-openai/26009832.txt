The text discusses a study, HPTN 052, which focused on HIV-1 serodiscordant couples where the infected partner was randomized to early ART for prevention purposes. The study aimed to evaluate predictors of adherence to medication in this context. Adherence was measured through pill counts and self-report questionnaires, with high levels of adherence observed in the participants. The study found that mental health scores were significantly associated with better adherence, while variables like substance use and social support did not show significant associations. The results suggest that different psychosocial variables may predict adherence in prevention-focused ART compared to treatment-focused ART. The study highlights the importance of evidence-based counseling, couple counseling, clear communication about prevention benefits, and feedback on viral suppression in optimizing adherence to ART for prevention purposes.
