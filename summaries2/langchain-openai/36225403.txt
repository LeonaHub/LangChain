The text discusses the association between Aortic Stenosis (AS) and acquired Von Willebrand disease, a condition characterized by VWF deficiency due to high shear stress from the stenotic valve. This condition, known as Heyde syndrome, can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding and other complications. Studies have shown that surgical valve replacement can reverse VWF deficiency. While this relationship is not widely recognized, it poses significant risks and requires further research to understand and address potential complications beyond anemia.
