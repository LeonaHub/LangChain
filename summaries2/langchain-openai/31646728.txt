The text discusses a qualitative study that explored the expectations of patients and caregivers who are not members of patient and family advisory councils (PFACs) regarding these councils. The study was conducted within a specific healthcare organization, focusing on the importance of who should be on a PFAC and how it should be comprised. Participants emphasized the need for transparency, diversity, and communication between PFACs and the broader patient population. The study highlighted the potential impact of PFACs on patient satisfaction, trust in the healthcare system, and the need for PFACs to be situated within the organizational structure to make real decisions. Recommendations included increasing awareness of PFACs, ensuring diversity in membership, and evaluating PFAC effectiveness. Limitations of the study were also acknowledged, including the small sample size and potential subjectivity in analysis. Overall, the study underscores the importance of effective communication and representation in PFACs to enhance patient-centered care and trust in healthcare systems.
