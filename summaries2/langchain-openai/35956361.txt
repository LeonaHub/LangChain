The study focused on investigating the dietary intake, serum vitamin A (SVA), and breast milk vitamin A (BMVA) concentrations of urban lactating Chinese women. Data was collected from 326 women in ten cities in China, with a focus on factors influencing vitamin A status. The findings revealed that a small proportion of lactating women met the recommended nutrient intake (RNI) of vitamin A, with meat and eggs being primary sources. While SVA levels were within normal limits for all women, nearly one-fifth had lower BMVA levels, indicating a risk of vitamin A deficiency for breastfed infants. Overweight or obese women had lower DVA intake and BMVA concentrations but higher SVA levels. Multiparous women were at a higher risk of inadequate BMVA. Positive associations were found between DVA, SVA, and BMVA, especially for women not using vitamin A supplements. The study highlighted the importance of maternal dietary intake in maintaining adequate vitamin A levels in breast milk and the need for further research on supplement use and vitamin A status.
