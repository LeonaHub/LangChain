The text discusses a study on the chronic oral toxicity effects of the neonicotinoid pesticide clothianidin on queen, worker, and male bumblebees. The research found that chronic exposure to clothianidin at field-realistic concentrations had differential effects on the survival of these bumblebee populations, with queens and males being more vulnerable than workers. The study also explored the genomic response of workers and males to sub-lethal clothianidin doses, identifying 332 clothianidin-sensitive genes associated with various biological functions. While workers and males had a similar response to clothianidin exposure at the organismal level, differences were observed in the expression of detoxification genes, suggesting potential differences in detoxification capacity. The study highlights the importance of considering the impact of neonicotinoids on wild bee populations and suggests the development of genomic tools for assessing neonicotinoid exposure levels and sub-lethal effects in the field.
