The text discusses the role of Delta-like ligand 4 (Dll4) in mediating radiation-induced long-term alterations in vascular structure and function. The study utilized a consomic rat model with reduced Dll4 expression to investigate the impact of Dll4 on vascular dysfunction following radiation injury. Through non-invasive 2nd window Near-Infrared (NIR) imaging, the study assessed changes in vascular permeability in the lungs and kidneys of rats exposed to radiation. Results showed that SS.BN3 (Dll4-low) rats had improved survival and reduced vascular injury compared to SS (Dll4-high) rats. The study also examined endothelial cell changes, Dll4 expression, and Notch signaling in response to radiation. The findings suggest that Dll4 plays a crucial role in radiation-induced vascular dysfunction and may be a potential therapeutic target for mitigating pathological vascular remodeling post-radiation injury. Further research will focus on understanding acute changes in lung vascular endothelium at the single-cell level.
