The text discusses the therapeutic potential of FTY720 in treating NK-cell leukemia, focusing on its mechanisms of action and efficacy in both in vitro and in vivo models. FTY720 induces apoptosis in leukemic NK cells by degrading the prosurvival protein Mcl-1 through a lysosomal pathway, leading to caspase-dependent cell death. Additionally, FTY720 alters sphingolipid metabolism, increasing levels of proapoptotic sphingosine in leukemic NK cells. The study demonstrates that FTY720 treatment results in complete remission in a rat model of aggressive NK-cell leukemia. The combination of FTY720 and nanoliposomal C6-ceramide shows synergistic effects on leukemic NK cells, suggesting a potential for combined therapies in NK-cell leukemia treatment. The findings highlight the unique mechanisms of FTY720 in targeting Mcl-1 and sphingolipid metabolism, distinct from ceramide/survivin signaling, and its promising therapeutic efficacy in NK-cell leukemia.
