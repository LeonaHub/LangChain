The text discusses the flaws in a study by Mast et al. that analyzed the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the coagulation cascade. The study used datasets from two other studies for comparison but had significant issues with the control group, library preparation methods, and sequencing depth. The designation of the control group as "healthy" was inaccurate due to the presence of comorbidities, the library preparation methods were dissimilar between the two groups, and the sequencing depth was insufficient for accurate differential expression analysis. These issues cast doubt on the validity of the conclusions drawn in Mast et al. and highlight the importance of rigorous quality control in research. The study's findings contradicted other research in the field, particularly regarding the impact of tissue factor in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The text emphasizes the need for high-quality data and proper analysis methods in COVID-19 research to ensure accurate and reliable results for future studies. Funding for the research was provided by various grants, with the funders having no role in the study design or publication process.
