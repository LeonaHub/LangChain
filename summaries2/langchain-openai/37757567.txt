The text discusses the importance of understanding the electrical and mechanical activities of the cardiovascular system during cardiac arrest (CA) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). It introduces the concept of using cross recurrence quantitative analysis (CRQA) to analyze the coupling of electrical (ECG) and mechanical (PPG) signals during CPR after CA. The study involved experiments on pigs to collect ECG and PPG signals during different stages of CPR. The results showed significant changes in the recurrence parameters (RR, DET, ENTR, TT) of ECG and PPG signals across the Baseline, CA, CPR, and recovery of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) periods. The findings indicated that the electrical-mechanical coupling dynamics were altered during CA and CPR, with CPR leading to improved stability and regularity in the signals. The study suggests that analyzing the electrical-mechanical coupling dynamics could serve as a functional indicator for evaluating the progress of CPR and may have implications for future clinical practice.
