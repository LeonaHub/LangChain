The study focused on estimating the Lifetime Risk (LTR) of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) among participants in the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS) cohort in Iran. The research aimed to assess the impact of key risk factors such as body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and hypercholesterolemia on the LTR of CVD. The analysis involved 10,222 participants aged 20 years and above, with follow-up data collected over a median of 18.02 years. The study found that the LTR of CVD was higher in men compared to women, with a significant increase in LTR associated with the presence of individual and aggregate risk factors. Women tended to have a lower LTR of CVD but a more pronounced effect of risk factors on CVD incidence. The study highlighted the importance of considering LTR in CVD risk assessment, especially for young individuals and women, and emphasized the potential benefits of primordial prevention and maintaining optimal risk factor levels to prolong CVD-free survival and improve overall cardiovascular health.
