The text discusses the impact of l-Lysine-coated Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (lys@IONPs) on the formation of microalgal biofilms using Chlorella vulgaris as a model organism. The synthesis and characterization of lys@IONPs are described, highlighting their size, structure, and magnetic properties. The interaction of lys@IONPs with microalgal cells is visualized, showing the entrapment of cells in nanoparticle clusters. Growth assays reveal concentration-dependent toxic effects of lys@IONPs on C. vulgaris, with cells adapting to tolerate higher concentrations over time. Biofilm assays demonstrate that low concentrations of lys@IONPs promote biofilm formation, while high concentrations initially inhibit it but can lead to increased biofilm formation over extended exposure periods. The study suggests that lys@IONPs can influence microalgal biofilm formation based on concentration and exposure time, offering potential applications in industrial processes.
