The HIGHway project aims to implement the Shared Decision Making â€” Renal Supportive Care (SDM-RSC) intervention on a larger scale to improve advance care planning (ACP) for dialysis patients. The project involves training social workers and nurses in ACP, utilizing a computer application to guide conversations, and engaging stakeholders throughout the process. The implementation timeline includes training cohorts, action periods, and data collection. Success will be measured by adoption of ACP, patient and provider outcomes, and quality of communication. The project will enroll social workers/nurses and patients, with data collected through surveys, interviews, and fidelity checks. The goal is to make ACP a routine part of care for dialysis patients and improve goal-concordant care at the end of life.
