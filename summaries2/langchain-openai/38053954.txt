The text discusses a study that investigated the effects of Quiet Eye (QE) training on attention in children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The study involved 72 children with ADHD who were assigned to a QE training group or a control group. The QE training involved targeting tasks with video demonstrations to optimize eye fixations on a target. Pre- and post-testing included neuropsychological tests and measurement of eye movement patterns during a visuomotor task. The results showed that QE training led to improvements in focused attention, concentration performance, and catch performance in the QE training group compared to the control group. The study suggests that QE training may be effective in enhancing attention in children with ADHD. However, further research is needed to explore the long-term effects of this intervention.
