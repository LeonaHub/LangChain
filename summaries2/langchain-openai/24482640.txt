The study investigated neutrophil apoptosis in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hemodialysis (HD) patients, as well as the impact of granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) on neutrophil function. Neutrophils from CKD and HD patients showed accelerated apoptosis and increased activation compared to healthy controls. The presence of uremic toxins and dialysis procedures were suggested as factors contributing to these abnormalities. Addition of GM-CSF to cultured neutrophils delayed apoptosis and improved cell viability in both patient groups. The study suggests that GM-CSF may have a therapeutic benefit in reducing neutrophil apoptosis and improving resistance to infections in CKD and HD patients. Further in vivo studies are needed to confirm these findings.
