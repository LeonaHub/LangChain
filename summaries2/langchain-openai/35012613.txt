The text discusses a study conducted in Norway to investigate breast cancer subtypes among immigrant groups from different regions of birth. The study analyzed data from 2005 to 2015, focusing on incidence rates and subtype distribution among immigrant women compared to non-immigrant women. The results showed that immigrant women from certain regions had varying rates of different breast cancer subtypes compared to non-immigrant women. Immigrants from Eastern Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia had lower rates of the luminal A-like subtype, while Asian women had higher rates of HER2+ tumors. The rates of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) were similar across immigrant groups, except for women from South-East Asia who had a lower rate. The study highlighted the importance of considering immigrant status and country of birth in understanding cancer outcomes, as these factors can influence genetic, social, lifestyle, and healthcare-seeking behaviors that impact subtype distribution. The findings suggest the need for tailored preventive and screening strategies based on the specific characteristics of breast cancer subtypes among immigrant populations.
