The text discusses the use of Functional Respiratory Imaging (FRI) parameters in predicting forced vital capacity (FVC) decline in patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). A retrospective study was conducted using data from a Phase 2 trial evaluating an anti-CTGF monoclonal antibody for IPF treatment. FRI parameters such as specific airway radius, fibrotic tissue percentage, and lobe volume were analyzed in relation to FVC decline. The study found correlations between declining FVC and FRI parameters, particularly in the lower lung lobes. FRI showed potential in capturing disease-related information not detected by conventional lung function tests. The study suggests that FRI parameters may be useful in monitoring regional changes in IPF and detecting disease progression in patients with preserved FVC.
