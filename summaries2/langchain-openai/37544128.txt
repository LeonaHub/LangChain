The text further delves into the methodology of a systematic review and meta-analysis conducted to assess the magnitude of the association between WPB and suicidal ideation and behavior. It discusses the results of the meta-analysis, including the pooled estimates of the association between WPB and suicidal ideation and behavior, as well as factors that mediate or moderate this relationship. The text concludes by emphasizing the importance of future research in understanding and addressing the consequences of exposure to WPB on mental health outcomes.
