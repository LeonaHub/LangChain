The text discusses a series of studies that aimed to evaluate the impact of exposure to social comparison information through Fitbit challenges on individuals' physical activity levels. The studies utilized within-subject, single-case experimental designs to assess changes in daily steps during baseline, challenge, and return to baseline phases. Participants competed against active and sedentary confederates in Fitbit challenges, with results showing variability in the effects of exposure to different levels of performance. Factors such as order of exposure, perceived similarity, and psychological closeness were suggested to influence participants' responses to social comparison. The studies highlighted the potential reinforcing or punishing effects of exposure to different levels of performance and the importance of individual and situational factors in determining the impact of social comparison on physical activity. Limitations included variability in syncing frequency, potential discrepancies in reported sedentary behavior, and challenges associated with controlling for real-time similarity between participant and confederate steps. The studies provide insights into the complexities of using social comparison in interventions to increase physical activity and suggest avenues for future research to optimize the efficacy of such interventions.
