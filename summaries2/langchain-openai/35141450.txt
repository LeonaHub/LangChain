The text discusses the impact of nandrolone decanoate (ND) treatment on the expression of aquaporin 1 (Aqp1) and aquaporin 9 (Aqp9) in different segments of the rat epididymis. The study involved ND treatment at varying doses for 2 or 12 weeks and analyzed the transcript levels of Aqp1 and Aqp9 in the initial segment, caput, corpus, and cauda epididymis. The results showed differential modulation of Aqp1 and Aqp9 expression in response to ND treatment, with segment-specific and dose-dependent effects observed. The study suggests that ND may influence Aqp1 and Aqp9 expression indirectly through systemic responses, potentially impacting sperm maturation and fertility. The complex regulatory mechanisms of Aqp1 and Aqp9 in the epididymis by hormonal factors are highlighted, indicating the need for further research to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying ND-induced changes in epididymal gene expression and potential implications for male fertility.
