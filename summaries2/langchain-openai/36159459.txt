The text discusses the extraction of dietary fiber from sweet potato peels using various methods and its effects on in vitro simulated intestinal fermentation. Different extraction techniques, such as hot water extraction, ultrasonic extraction, subcritical water extraction, and microwave extraction, were employed to obtain soluble dietary fiber. The study investigated the impact of these dietary fibers on intestinal fermentation, including gas production, short-chain fatty acid production, pH levels, ammonia content, reducing sugar content, and degradation rate. The results indicated that the dietary fiber from sweet potato peels positively influenced gut microbiota composition, promoting the abundance of beneficial bacteria and reducing harmful bacteria. The dietary fiber enhanced the production of short-chain fatty acids, improved intestinal health, and regulated intestinal microecology. The ultrasonic extraction method showed the most significant improvement in overall intestinal microecological health.
