The text discusses a study conducted in Benin, West Africa, to analyze the genetic and morphometric characteristics of Aedes aegypti populations across different landscape types. Mosquito specimens were collected from urban, semi-urban, and sylvatic sites, and genetic analysis revealed high genetic diversity with seven distinct haplotypes. The study also assessed wing size and shape variation among specimens from different landscape types, showing significant differences in centroid size but not in wing shape. The sylvatic site exhibited greater morphological diversity, correlating with the higher number of haplotypes found there. The study highlights the high genetic and morphological diversity of Ae. aegypti at a microgeographical scale, providing insights into the biology of this important disease vector.
