The text discusses a case of congenitally abnormal fibrinogen Ise characterized by delayed release of fibrinopeptide B due to a single amino acid substitution of cysteine for glycine at Bβ 15. This abnormality results in prolonged thrombin time but normal reptilase time. The delayed exposure of the NH2-terminus of the β-chain affects fibrin clot formation by inhibiting the binding of the NH2-terminus of the α-chain, leading to defective fibrin monomer polymerization. High concentrations of thrombin can cleave not only the Aα Arg19-Val20 bond but also the COOH-terminal region of α-chains, causing further degradation. The study highlights the importance of using high concentrations of thrombin for analyzing abnormal fibrinogens with defective fibrinopeptide release.
