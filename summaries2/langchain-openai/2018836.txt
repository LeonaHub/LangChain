The text discusses a case study of a patient with congenitally abnormal fibrinogen Ise, characterized by normal reptilase time, prolonged thrombin time, and delayed release of fibrinopeptide B due to a single amino acid substitution of cysteine for glycine at Bβ 15. This substitution affects the exposure of the NH2-terminus of the fibrin β-chain, leading to prolonged thrombin time. The study also explores the role of Bβ-chains in fibrin clot formation, highlighting the importance of the NH2-terminus of the β-chain in promoting fibrin polymerization. Additionally, the text discusses the effects of a high concentration of thrombin on fibrinogen chains, demonstrating the cleavage of α-chains and the importance of using high thrombin concentrations for analyzing abnormal fibrinogens with defective fibrinopeptide release.
