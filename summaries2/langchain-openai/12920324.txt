The study investigated the renal consequences of prolonged hyperglycemia in nonobese GK rats as a model for diabetic nephropathy. The rats exhibited functional and morphological progression in the kidneys, including glomerulosclerosis, mesangial cell proliferation, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and inflammatory cell infiltration, similar to human diabetic nephropathy. The expression of Î±-SMA and type IV collagen increased, along with macrophage infiltration, in GK rats with prolonged hyperglycemia. These changes were not observed in age-matched Wistar rats, suggesting that the renal lesions were due to hyperglycemia rather than aging. Despite these pathological changes, creatinine clearance and BUN did not worsen in GK rats. The study concluded that prolonged hyperglycemia may be a key factor in inducing progressive diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetes, with aging and obesity potentially exacerbating renal injury.
