The text discusses the synthesis and characterization of oligosaccharide-based block copolymers (BCPs) with high immiscibility and small domain sizes, achieved through CuAAC click chemistry. The study focuses on the influence of electrostatic interactions at the BCP interface on self-assembly, particularly in thin films using solvent vapor annealing (SVA). The charge-modified BCPs exhibit enhanced long-range ordered nanostructures, specifically a unidirectional lamellar (Lam) alignment, facilitated by ionic nanochannels formed by T+/counteranion– junctions. The research demonstrates the potential of leveraging CuAAC chemistry and n-alkylated triazolium+/counteranion– junctions to control BCP self-assembly for applications in nanopatterning and ionic transport.
