The study investigated the expression of epithelial growth factors, apoptosis-regulating proteins, and CD57+ cells in inflammatory periradicular lesions (IPLs) at different stages of development, specifically periapical granulomas (PGs) and periapical cysts (PCs). The research found CD57+ cells in approximately half of the lesions, with a higher presence in IPLs with moderate/intense inflammatory infiltrates. Bcl-2 expression did not vary significantly among the groups. EGF and KGF expression were more common in PCs than in PGs, suggesting a role in stimulating epithelial cell proliferation. EGFR expression did not correlate with the parameters evaluated. KGF showed greater expression in PCs than in PGs, with higher expression in small PCs compared to large PCs, indicating a role in the initial stages of cyst development. Ki-67 expression was limited in the epithelial lining of PCs, with no significant differences among the groups. Overall, the study suggests that EGF, KGF, and CD57+ cells may influence the development of IPLs, with KGF potentially playing a crucial role in the early stages of PC formation.
