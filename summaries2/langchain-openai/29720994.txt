The Abyssinian pea, a distinct taxon of uncertain origin, is cultivated in Ethiopia and Yemen and shows limited genetic diversity. Studies suggest it may have arisen from a hybridization event between Pisum sativum and P. fulvum, but genetic analysis indicates a closer relationship to P. s. ssp. sativum or P. s. ssp. elatius. The indehiscent pod trait in the Abyssinian pea may have evolved independently, but the lack of seed dormancy's timing relative to the divergence from P. s. ssp. sativum remains unclear. The taxonomic treatment of P. s. ssp. abyssinicum is debated, with questions about its distribution and unique alleles. The study concludes that the Abyssinian pea likely resulted from a hybridization event between P. s. ssp. sativum and P. s. ssp. elatius, with the origin of certain traits still under investigation.
