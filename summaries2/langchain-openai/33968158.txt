The text discusses the significance of PAR2 (Protease-Activated Receptor 2) in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and its potential role in cancer progression. It highlights the relationship between PAR2 promoter methylation and gene expression in LUAD cells, indicating that hypomethylation of the PAR2 promoter is associated with increased PAR2 expression and poor prognosis in LUAD patients. The study utilized bioinformatics analysis, cell culture experiments, and molecular assays to demonstrate that inhibiting PAR2 promoter methylation can enhance PAR2 expression and promote cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. The findings suggest that PAR2 promoter hypomethylation may play a crucial role in LUAD progression and could potentially serve as a therapeutic target in the future. Further research is needed to validate specific methylated sites and enhance the understanding of PAR2's involvement in LUAD.
