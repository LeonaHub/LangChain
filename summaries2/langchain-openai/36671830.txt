The text discusses a molecular study focused on rarely studied taxa within the Astragalus genus, particularly in the subgenus Hypoglottis. The study aimed to resolve taxonomic issues and determine the systematic positions of these taxa using DNA sequences. The analysis included species from sections Stereothrix and Hypoglottidei, revealing non-monophyly within these sections. The study also highlighted the rapid and ongoing biological radiation and speciation within Astragalus in western Asia. The results suggest the need to revise the current sectional classification and merge sections into a larger, monophyletic entity. The text emphasizes the importance of using genome-wide DNA sequences for a more comprehensive understanding of Astragalus evolution and taxonomy.
