The text describes a study on the potential therapeutic application of Amblyomin-X in treating ependymoma (EPN), a malignant brain tumor. The study involved evaluating the effects of Amblyomin-X on EPN cells in vitro and in an intracranial xenograft model in rats. The researchers conducted cytotoxicity assays using MTT assays and flow cytometry to assess cell viability and apoptosis induction. They also performed ultrastructural analysis using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and labeled EPN cells with multimodal iron oxide nanoparticles (MION) for tracking in vivo. The study included MRI analysis to monitor tumor growth and histological analysis of tumor tissues. The results showed that Amblyomin-X selectively induced cell death in EPN cells without affecting normal cells, leading to tumor regression in the xenograft model. The study highlights the potential of Amblyomin-X as a promising anti-EPN drug candidate.
