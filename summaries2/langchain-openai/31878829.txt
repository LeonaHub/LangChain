The study investigated the role of the lncRNA HOXA11-AS in keloid formation, focusing on its interactions with miR-124-3p and TGFβR1. The research found that HOXA11-AS was upregulated in keloid tissues and fibroblasts, promoting fibroblast survival and angiogenesis. Through sponging miR-124-3p, HOXA11-AS upregulated TGFβR1, activating PI3K/Akt signaling and inhibiting apoptosis in keloid fibroblasts. The study suggests that targeting HOXA11-AS or restoring miR-124-3p levels could be potential therapeutic strategies for keloid treatment. Limitations include a small sample size and the need for further in vivo and clinical studies.
