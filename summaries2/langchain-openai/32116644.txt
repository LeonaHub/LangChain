The text discusses the role of electrophile signaling in the central nervous system (CNS), focusing on endogenous reactive electrophilic metabolites and their impact on neurodegenerative diseases. It describes high-throughput chemoproteomics methods to profile potential LDE sensors, such as ABPP and T-REX, which allow for the identification of LDE modification sites. The text also delves into the regulation of Keap1/Nrf2/Antioxidant Response (AR) signaling in multiple sclerosis (MS) and the therapeutic effects of dimethyl fumarate (DMF) in treating MS. Various potential targets and pathways implicated in DMF's mechanism of action are discussed, including Keap1/Nrf2/AR signaling, PKCθ, GAPDH, HCA2, p65 and IκBα, and RSK/MSK kinases. The text highlights the importance of understanding electrophile signaling in disease contexts, aging, and MS etiology, as well as the
