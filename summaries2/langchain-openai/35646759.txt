The study focused on factors influencing COVID-19 preventive behaviors among Thai people using the PRECEDE model. Data from a web-based survey of 6,521 participants were analyzed, revealing that social support, age, flu-like symptoms, gender, perceived risk of exposure, lockdown policy, and residential area significantly influenced COVID-19 preventive behaviors. Social support was the most influential factor. The study highlighted the importance of communication strategies, age-specific interventions, risk perception, lockdown policies, and regional differences in promoting preventive behaviors. Education and career were not significant factors, suggesting the need for tailored strategies to enhance COVID-19 prevention practices in different demographic groups. The findings provide valuable insights for policymakers and health professionals to develop effective interventions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in Thailand.
