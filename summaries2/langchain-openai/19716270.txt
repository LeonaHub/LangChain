The text discusses a study that investigated the impact of intrinsic motivation (IM) on cognitive recovery in individuals with schizophrenia through the use of motivational instructional techniques in a computer-based arithmetic learning program. The study found that incorporating IM-enhancing strategies led to greater learning, increased IM for the task, and higher perceived self-competency. Participants in the motivation group showed significant improvements in arithmetic skills, intrinsic motivation, and perceived competency compared to the control group. The study also highlighted the importance of perceived competency and autonomy in enhancing motivation and learning outcomes. While the specific motivational strategies used in the study were effective, the results suggest that different learners may respond better to varied instructional techniques. The study contributes to the understanding of the relationship between motivation, cognition, and psychosocial rehabilitation in schizophrenia, although further research is needed to explore individual effects of specific motivational instructions and address potential limitations in sample size and participant computer skills.
