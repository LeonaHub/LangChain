The text discusses the importance of wound assessment and monitoring in the healing process, emphasizing the need for reliable measurement instruments. It describes the development and validation of a Portuguese version of the RESVECH 2.0 scale for assessing chronic wounds. The study involved cultural and linguistic adaptation, reliability testing, and validity testing. Results showed good internal consistency, agreement between raters, and validity in relation to other wound assessment scales and quality of life measures. The study highlighted the impact of factors like BMI on wound healing outcomes. The Portuguese version of RESVECH 2.0 was found to be a valuable tool for wound assessment in clinical practice and research, with potential to improve treatment outcomes and reduce the prevalence of chronic wounds. Further research is recommended to assess its psychometric properties in different settings.
