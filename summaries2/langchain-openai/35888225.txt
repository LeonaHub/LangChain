The text discusses the impact of measurement errors on surface texture parameters, focusing on the presence of additional valleys and repetitive measurements using optical methods. Various parameters react differently to errors, with changes depending on the type of surface and the radius of the valley. Skewness and kurtosis are commonly used to describe surface texture, with alternative parameters like Sp/Sz and Sq/Sa showing lower sensitivity to errors. Repetitive measurements can lead to variations in surface texture parameters, with some parameters being more stable than others. The research aims to improve the quality of industry surface texture assessment, with future studies planned to explore the impacts of other measurement errors beyond optical methods.
