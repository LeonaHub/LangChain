The text discusses the structural and functional aspects of the gut-enriched Kr√ºppel-like factor (GKLF), a transcription factor involved in regulating cell growth and differentiation. GKLF contains distinct domains for transcriptional activation and repression, with acidic amino acid residues playing a crucial role in transactivation. The study demonstrates that GKLF's transactivation ability depends on two clusters of acidic residues in its N-terminus, which are also essential for its interaction with the co-activator proteins p300/CBP. The interaction between GKLF and p300/CBP is shown to be important for mediating GKLF's transcriptional activity. Furthermore, GKLF's growth-suppressing effect is linked to its transactivation ability, as mutations in the acidic residues abolish both transactivation and growth inhibition. Overall, the study highlights the complex mechanisms by which GKLF regulates transcription and cell growth through interactions with co-activator proteins.
