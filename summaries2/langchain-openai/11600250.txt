The text discusses a study on the effects of Trypsin-Chymotrypsin preparation on burn patients, focusing on the modulation of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1Î² and IL-6. The study involved administering the preparation to burn patients and analyzing changes in cytokine levels, oedema, inflammation, pain, wound epithelialization, and scar formation. Results showed that the treatment reduced oedema, inflammation, and cytokine activity, accelerated wound healing, and improved scar outcomes compared to untreated control cases. The study highlights the potential of Trypsin-Chymotrypsin in managing burn injuries and suggests further research on anti-inflammatory cytokines for a deeper understanding of burn injury pathophysiology. Acknowledgements were given to the supporting institutions and individuals involved in the study.
