The text discusses the challenges and considerations in the management of recurrent ovarian endometriomas, particularly focusing on the use of dienogest as a long-term therapy post-surgery. It highlights the limitations and side effects of other hormonal therapies commonly used, emphasizing the need for a medication with minimal side effects and higher compliance for long-term prevention of recurrence. The study conducted retrospectively on 203 patients who underwent surgery for ovarian endometrioma and subsequent treatment with dienogest, showed promising results with a low recurrence rate of 1.5% and tolerable side effects. The study suggests that dienogest therapy can be safely extended for a longer duration until the patient decides to pursue pregnancy, providing a potential alternative to surgical re-intervention for recurrent endometriomas. Further research is recommended to determine the optimal duration of dienogest therapy in patients effectively.
