The text discusses a rare case of a hepatic falciform ligament clear cell myomelanocytic tumor (CCMMT), which belongs to the perivascular epithelioid cell (PEComa) family of tumors. The case involves a 29-year-old woman with liver cancer rupture, leading to surgical intervention. The diagnosis was confirmed through imaging studies, surgical excision, and pathological examination. The text details the histological and immunohistochemical characteristics of CCMMT, including its similarities and differences with other tumors. Differential diagnoses, imaging manifestations, and treatment options are also discussed. The importance of long-term follow-up and potential targeted therapies, such as mTOR inhibitors, for PEComa are highlighted. The study emphasizes the need for further research and clinical trials to improve the understanding and management of this rare tumor type.
