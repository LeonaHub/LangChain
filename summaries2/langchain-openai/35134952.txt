The text discusses Haldane's Rule, which states that in hybrid offspring of different animal races, the heterogametic sex (i.e., the sex with different sex chromosomes) tends to show reduced fitness, rarity, or sterility. In birds, females are the heterogametic sex, and studies have confirmed that hybrid females exhibit greater fitness reductions compared to hybrid males. The text explores various explanations for Haldane's Rule, such as dominance theory and the "Large X-effect." It also discusses the faster evolution of Z-linked loci in birds and the potential role of the Z-chromosome in reproductive isolation. The text reviews studies that have quantified introgression rates for different genetic loci in birds, with the majority supporting Haldane's Rule. It highlights the importance of considering hybrid fitness estimates and field observations in confirming the mechanisms behind introgression patterns. Exceptions to Haldane's Rule, such as sex-biased dispersal and ancient introgression, are also discussed. The text notes the limited use of genomic approaches to estimate introgression rates and suggests future research directions to better understand the genetic mechanisms underlying Haldane's Rule.
