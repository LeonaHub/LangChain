The text discusses the interaction of human TATA-binding protein (TBP) with promoter DNA, specifically the AdMLP consensus sequence. The study compares the binding kinetics and DNA bending induced by human TBP with those of yeast TBP. The results show that human TBP rapidly binds to and bends the promoter DNA, forming a stable complex with a more severe helical bend compared to yeast TBP. The study refutes a model proposed by Zhao and Herr, which suggests a slow DNA bending process for human TBP, highlighting discrepancies in their findings. The text emphasizes the simultaneous binding and bending of DNA by TBP as a common theme in promoter recognition, with differences in affinity and kinetics suggesting distinct recognition mechanisms between human and yeast TBPs. Further investigations are needed to understand the detailed recognition pathways of human and yeast TBPs.
