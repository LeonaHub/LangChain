The text discusses a study conducted in England to assess kcal labelling practices, customer purchasing behavior, and levels of noticing and using kcal labelling in the out-of-home food sector (OHFS) prior to the implementation of mandatory kcal labelling regulations. The study found that only a minority of sampled businesses provided any form of kcal labelling, with high energy content in purchased and consumed meals exceeding public health recommendations. Customers tended to underestimate the energy content of their purchases, and levels of noticing and using kcal labelling were low. The study highlights the need for increased implementation, consistency, and prominence of kcal labelling to potentially reduce overconsumption in the OHFS. Limitations include missing data, reliance on self-reporting, and exclusions of certain outlet types. Future research should examine the impact of mandatory kcal labelling on consumer behavior and public health outcomes in the OHFS.
