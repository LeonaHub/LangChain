The text discusses a retrospective study conducted at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital in Ghana to analyze data on animal bites and rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) from 2013 to 2016. The study included 1030 participants, with a majority of animal bites occurring in children under 30 years old, primarily from dog bites. The study found that delays in initiating PEP were common, with 11.7% starting treatment after a week. Factors associated with delays included being male and receiving bites more than 5 km away from the hospital. However, 95.2% of participants completed the full PEP schedule. The study highlights the importance of enforcing dog vaccinations and educating the public, especially children, on preventing animal bites to reduce the risk of rabies transmission. Limitations included self-reported data and the lack of follow-up on rabies incidence post-PEP. The study emphasizes the need for improved patient counseling and public health interventions to prevent human rabies in Ghana.
