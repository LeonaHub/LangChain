The text discusses the development and characterization of a new generation of magnetic particle imaging (MPI) tracers known as MCP 3. These tracers were synthesized using a coprecipitation method and coated with CMD for stabilization. The MCP 3 demonstrated excellent MPI properties, including a strong MPS signal amplitude, high saturation magnetization, and good dispersion stability. Phantom studies using PVC tube phantoms filled with MCP 3 and Resovist® showed that MCP 3 outperformed Resovist® in terms of sensitivity, spatial resolution, and selectivity. The MCP 3 tracers provided better visualization, higher signal-to-noise ratio, and improved resolution in dual-tube phantom experiments, making them promising candidates for future in vivo studies. The study highlights the potential of MCP 3 as a superior MPI tracer compared to Resovist® and demonstrates the effectiveness of the coprecipitation method in developing high-performance MPI tracers.
