The text discusses a study on the folding of apomyoglobin (apoMb) and the effects of substitutions at position 131 on the stability of the protein. The study compares the stability changes resulting from overpacking, underpacking, and polar substitutions at this position in both the intermediate (I) and native (N) forms of apoMb. The results suggest that specific side-chain packing interactions are not the primary stabilizing factor in the I form of apoMb, as overpacking substitutions actually increase stability. Instead, burial of nonpolar surface area appears to be the dominant contributor to stability in the I form, indicating a molten globule-like conformation. In contrast, the N form of apoMb shows multistate unfolding transitions and is less sensitive to overpacking substitutions, suggesting structural plasticity in the region of position 131. The study highlights the importance of hydrophobic interactions in determining stability in the I form of apoMb and raises questions about the role of specific side-chain packing interactions in equilibrium intermediates of proteins.
