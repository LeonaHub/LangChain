The text discusses the potential neuroprotective effects of β-carbolines and R-(-)-deprenyl on differentiated PC12 cells exposed to S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine (SNAP), a donor of nitric oxide. The study explores the impact of these compounds on mitochondrial dysfunction, cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation, ROS formation, and glutathione depletion induced by SNAP. Results indicate that β-carbolines and R-(-)-deprenyl inhibit cell death by preserving mitochondrial membrane potential, reducing cytochrome c release, and suppressing caspase-3 activation. The protective effects are attributed to the inhibition of ROS formation and restoration of GSH levels. Harmaline and harmalol at 25 µM exhibit the most significant protective effects against SNAP toxicity without causing cytotoxicity, suggesting a potential neuroprotective role for β-carbolines in mitigating neuronal cell injury associated with Parkinson's disease.
