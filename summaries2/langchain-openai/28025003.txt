The text discusses the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) by cytochrome P450 enzymes, leading to the production of oxylipin metabolites with diverse biological functions. Specifically, it focuses on the roles of ω-hydroxy PUFAs derived from arachidonic acid (ARA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The synthesis of these metabolites, including 20-HETE, 20-HEPE, and 22-HDoHE, is described, highlighting the challenges in controlling partial hydrogenation during their production. In vivo studies in rats showed that 20-HETE induced pain, while 20-HEPE and 22-HDoHE did not. In vitro experiments revealed that 20-HEPE and 22-HDoHE were potent TRPV1 agonists, suggesting potential therapeutic properties without inducing pain. The study underscores the importance of further research into the distinct biological roles of ω-3 and ω-6 hydroxy metabolites and their potential therapeutic applications.
