The text discusses a retrospective cohort study on arthroscopic treatment of popliteal cysts, focusing on recurrence rates, functional outcomes, and associated intra-articular pathologies. The study included 97 patients with a mean follow-up of 39 months. The arthroscopic technique involved excising the cyst wall and valvular mechanism, with concurrent management of intra-articular pathologies. The study found a low recurrence rate of 12.4% assessed by ultrasonography, with good functional outcomes. Severe chondral lesions were associated with an increased risk of cyst recurrence. The study adds to existing literature by highlighting the importance of addressing concomitant lesions in popliteal cyst pathogenesis. Safety concerns were addressed, with no persistent complications observed. Limitations included a wide follow-up range and a younger age group. The study's strengths included a large cohort and consecutive patient inclusion. In conclusion, arthroscopic treatment of popliteal cysts showed favorable outcomes, with severe chondral lesions posing a higher risk of recurrence.
