The text discusses the importance of mucosal immunity in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the potential for mucosal vaccines to enhance immune responses. It explores the role of BAFF and APRIL cytokines, as well as homeostatic chemokines like CXCL13, CCL19, and CCL21, in regulating immune responses during viral respiratory infections. The formation of inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT) is highlighted as a crucial factor in protecting against viral infections. Studies suggest that mucosal vaccines, particularly those targeting BAFF/APRIL or CXCL13 combined with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, could enhance local mucosal immune responses and provide protection against the virus. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying iBALT formation and function, as well as the potential of mucosal vaccines in combating SARS-CoV-2 infection.
