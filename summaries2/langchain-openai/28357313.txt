The text describes the synthesis and biological evaluation of ergosterone-triazol hybrid molecules as potential antileishmanial agents. The compounds were synthesized through a series of chemical reactions involving ergosterol oxidation and coupling with Girard reagents. These molecules were tested for their cytotoxic effects on Leishmania mexicana promastigotes and human dermic fibroblasts. The compounds showed selective toxicity against the parasites, inducing cell death mechanisms such as phosphatidylserine exposure, mitochondrial hyperpolarization, cell cycle alterations, and ultrastructural changes. Additionally, the compounds triggered an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and intracellular calcium release from acidocalcisomes. The study suggests that Erg-GTr and Erg-GTr2 induce regulated cell death in Leishmania parasites, making them potential candidates for further development as antileishmanial drugs.
