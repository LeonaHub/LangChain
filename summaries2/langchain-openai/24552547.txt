The text discusses a study that investigated the effects of prepubertal exposure to the environmental chemicals bisphenol A (BPA) and genistein on the serum proteome of rats. The study utilized TMT-MS analysis to identify differentially expressed proteins in the sera of rats exposed to BPA and genistein on postnatal days 21 and 35. The results showed distinct protein expression patterns associated with carcinogenesis and chemoprevention in response to BPA and genistein exposure. Proteins related to cancer pathways were altered by both chemicals, with BPA increasing the expression of proteins favoring carcinogenesis and genistein decreasing the expression of such proteins. The study validated the TMT-MS results using Western blot analysis, confirming the reliability of the technique for identifying serum proteins. The findings suggest that quantitative proteomics via TMT-MS is a valuable tool for identifying molecular targets and potential biomarkers of susceptibility to environmental chemicals. The study highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms of action of BPA and genistein in breast cancer risk and provides insights for future human studies.
