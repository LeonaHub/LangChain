The text discusses the use of Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) measures in survivors and survivorship care of high-grade glioma, the most common primary brain tumor in adults. PROs are essential for evaluating the impact of treatments on patient function and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Various PRO measures are used in clinical trials and clinical practice for patients with high-grade glioma, including HRQoL assessments and symptom burden evaluations. Challenges in integrating PROs include missing data, patient's ability to self-report, and engaging healthcare professionals. The text also highlights the importance of involving caregivers as proxies and the potential benefits of using PRO measures in improving patient-caregiver-healthcare team communication and symptom management. The use of new technical solutions for remote data collection and real-time sharing of PRO results may enhance survivorship care for patients with high-grade glioma.
