The study investigated Clostridium difficile colonization in preterm neonates (PN) over a one-year period in a French NICU. Fecal samples were collected at various time points, and C. difficile strains were isolated and characterized. The study found a high colonization rate in PN, with a significant increase in colonization frequency after hospital discharge. Non-toxigenic strains were predominant, with two specific ribotypes (FR082 and 032) being most common. Toxigenic strains emerged after discharge, belonging to RTs commonly found in infants and adults with C. difficile infections. MLVA typing revealed genetic relatedness among strains, suggesting potential hospital transmission. The study highlights the dynamics of C. difficile colonization in PN, with implications for understanding reservoirs and transmission routes in healthcare settings.
