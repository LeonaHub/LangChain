The study focused on patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and investigated the impact of genetic mutations, specifically BRAF V600E and TERT promoter mutations, on patient outcomes and the choice between lobectomy (LT) and total thyroidectomy (TT) as initial surgical approaches. The results showed that TERT promoter mutations were significantly associated with worse outcomes, while BRAF V600E mutation alone did not have a significant impact. Patients without TERT promoter mutations with 1-4 cm intrathyroidal PTC could achieve favorable outcomes with LT. The study highlighted the importance of genetic markers in predicting prognosis and guiding surgical decisions to prevent overtreatment and reduce complications for patients with PTC.
