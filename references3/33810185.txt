High temperatures at the end of the season are frequent under Mediterranean conditions, affecting final grain quality. This study determined the deposition patterns throughout grain filling of dry matter, dietary fiber, phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity for four barley genotypes under two contrasting temperatures. Deposition pattern for dietary fiber followed that of grain weight. Genotypic differences for duration were more significant than for rate. Anthocyanins followed a second-degree polynomial pattern, reaching a maximum before grain maturation. Free and bound phenols decreased as grain developed, suggesting that they are synthesized in early stages. Rate of bound phenols deposition was more sensitive to genotypic changes. Overall, antioxidant capacity decreased over time; the decay being less steep under stress for all genotypes. Heat stress negatively affected grain weight. It did not alter the profile of Î²-glucans and arabinoxylans deposition but positively changed the accumulation of some phenolic compounds, increasing the antioxidant capacity differentially across genotypes. These results support the growing of food barley in high-temperature stress-prone areas, as some bioactive compound and antioxidant capacity will increase, regardless of the smaller grain size. Moreover, if a market develops for food-barley ingredients, early harvesting of non-mature grain to maximize antioxidant capacity should be considered.
