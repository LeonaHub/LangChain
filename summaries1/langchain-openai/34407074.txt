The study focused on investigating the structure, function, and dynamics of farmland arthropod communities in a maize farmland plot in Northeast China. The research analyzed the composition and quantity structure of the insect community, the variation of species frequency, the dynamic changes of nutritional function groups, ecological dominance, and biodiversity distribution. The findings revealed that herbivorous insects were dominant in the farmland, with corn caterpillars and corn grass aphids being significant pests. Predatory and parasitic insects played crucial roles as natural enemies. The study highlighted the importance of biodiversity in farmland ecosystems and the impact of human factors on community stability. The research provided insights into the spatial relationships within insect communities and laid the groundwork for future studies on self-regulation and pest control in agricultural ecosystems.
