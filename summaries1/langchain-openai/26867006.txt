The text discusses the impact of diameter distribution on charge transport in polydisperse semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) networks. It highlights the use of near-infrared electroluminescence as a sensitive measure to study the distribution of carriers within mixed SWNT networks. The study shows that the transport paths in these networks are non-uniform and strongly influenced by the energy level distribution of the nanotubes. The presence of small bandgap nanotubes leads to preferential transport through them, even if they are a minority within the network. The text emphasizes the importance of considering the diameter distribution in SWNT networks for optimizing device performance and minimizing costs.
