The text discusses the development and characterization of chitosan nanoparticles loaded with betaine (BT) and nedaplatin (ND) for potential breast cancer treatment. The nanoparticles were synthesized using the ionotropic gelation method and were further coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to enhance their properties. The study evaluated the physicochemical characteristics, drug release profiles, cytotoxicity against MCF-7 cells, and in vivo efficacy in a breast cancer rat model. Results showed that PEGylated CS nanoparticles containing BT and ND exhibited enhanced cytotoxicity and tumor size reduction compared to free drugs. The combination of BT and ND in PEGylated nanoparticles demonstrated the most significant anticancer effects, suggesting a promising therapeutic strategy for breast cancer treatment.
