The study focused on the impact of l-Lysine-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (lys@IONPs) on the formation of microalgal biofilms using Chlorella vulgaris as a model organism. The nanoparticles were synthesized and characterized, showing a concentration-dependent effect on biofilm formation. At lower concentrations (12.5-200 µg/mL), lys@IONPs promoted cell growth and biofilm formation, while higher concentrations (≥400 µg/mL) initially inhibited biofilm formation but led to adaptation and increased biofilm formation over time. The results suggest that lys@IONPs can influence microalgal biofilm formation based on concentration and exposure time, highlighting their potential for industrial applications.
