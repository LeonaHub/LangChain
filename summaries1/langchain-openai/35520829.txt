The text discusses the synthesis of stable colloidal solutions of silver sulfide quantum dots in heavy water (D2O) for the first time. The study involved various characterization techniques such as dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray energy dispersive analysis, and small-angle neutron scattering. The results showed that the colloidal solutions retained stability and small quantum dot sizes (3-19 nm) over long-term storage. The synthesis conditions allowed for control of quantum dot sizes by adjusting reagent concentrations. The colloidal solutions in heavy water exhibited slightly larger quantum dot sizes compared to those in ordinary water, indicating differences in stabilization mechanisms. These findings pave the way for further studies on the structure of silver sulfide quantum dots using small-angle neutron scattering.
