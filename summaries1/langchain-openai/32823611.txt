The text discusses the importance of developing flood-tolerant crops to ensure global food security in the face of climate change. It highlights the role of ethylene in mediating hypoxia tolerance in plants, particularly through the stabilization of ERFVII transcription factors and the induction of hypoxia-responsive genes. The study investigates the integration of ethylene signaling in different Solanum species, including potato, tomato, and bittersweet, to determine its impact on hypoxia acclimation and flooding tolerance. Results show that ethylene enhances hypoxia tolerance in bittersweet and eggplant but not in tomato and S. pennellii. Additionally, ethylene-mediated hypoxia responses are conserved in bittersweet and a waterlogging-tolerant potato cultivar, while being uncoupled in the roots of a waterlogging-intolerant potato cultivar and tomato. The study suggests that understanding genes involved in ethylene-mediated hypoxia acclimation can help identify key signaling pathways for enhancing flooding and hypoxia tolerance in vegetable crops.
