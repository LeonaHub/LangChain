The study evaluated the microhardness and microstructure of coronal dentin using the BioDent Reference Point Indentation (RPI) technique and traditional Knoop hardness method. Results showed that dentin hardness decreased from superficial to deep dentin, with BioDent RPI providing more consistent values. Micro-Raman spectroscopy revealed differences in chemical composition, with superficial dentin having higher mineral content and deep dentin having more organic matrix and carbonate. The degree of crystallinity decreased from superficial to deep dentin. The study suggests a positive relationship between dentin hardness and mineral content, and a negative relationship with carbonate content and crystallinity. Overall, the findings highlight the gradient nature of dentin as a biocomposite material with varying mechanical properties and microstructure by location.
