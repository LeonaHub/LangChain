The text discusses the development and characterization of a novel multicore particle (MCP 3) as a potential magnetic particle imaging (MPI) tracer. The synthesis of MCP 3 involved alkaline coprecipitation of ferrous chloride followed by oxidation and coating with carboxymethyl dextran sodium salt. Physicochemical characterization revealed a clustered core structure predominantly composed of maghemite. MCP 3 demonstrated superior magnetic properties compared to Resovist®, with higher MPS signal amplitudes and saturation magnetization. Phantom studies using PVC tubes filled with MCP 3 and Resovist® at varying concentrations showed better SNR, spatial resolution, and selectivity for MCP 3. Dual-tube phantoms further demonstrated the improved performance of MCP 3 in distinguishing between tubes of different diameters. Overall, MCP 3 showed promising results in terms of sensitivity, selectivity, and spatial resolution, making it a potential candidate for future in vivo MPI studies. The study highlights the potential of coprecipitation methods for developing high-performance MPI tracers.
