The text discusses the challenges and considerations in the management of recurrent endometrioma post-surgery, focusing on the use of dienogest as a long-term therapy option. The study conducted retrospectively on 203 patients who underwent surgery for ovarian endometrioma and were subsequently treated with dienogest. The results showed a low recurrence rate of 1.5% with dienogest therapy, indicating its efficacy in preventing recurrence. The study also highlighted the tolerable side effect profile of dienogest, with irregular bleeding being the most common side effect. The findings suggest that dienogest is a safe and well-tolerated option for long-term prevention of recurrent endometrioma, particularly in young patients. Further research is needed to determine the optimal duration of dienogest therapy in patients.
