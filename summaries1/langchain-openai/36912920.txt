The study focused on arthroscopic treatment of popliteal cysts, assessing recurrence rates and functional outcomes. A significant association was found between cyst recurrence and severe chondral lesions. Functional improvements were noted post-surgery, with good outcomes in terms of symptom relief and patient satisfaction. The study included a large cohort and provided detailed intraoperative assessments. While there were limitations such as wide follow-up range and loss to follow-up, the study's strengths included consecutive patient inclusion and strict follow-up protocols. Overall, arthroscopic treatment of popliteal cysts showed low recurrence rates and positive functional outcomes, with severe chondral lesions posing a higher risk of recurrence.
