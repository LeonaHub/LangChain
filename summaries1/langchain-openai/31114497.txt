The study focused on assessing the preventability of bleeding cases associated with oral anticoagulant therapy reported through the Campania spontaneous reporting system from July 2012 to December 2017. A total of 453 ICSRs were analyzed, with 253 cases reporting bleeding events. The majority of bleeding cases were related to indirect oral anticoagulants, with warfarin being the most commonly reported suspected drug. The preventability assessment revealed that 22.9% of bleeding cases were preventable, with critical criteria mainly related to healthcare professionals' practices, particularly drug-drug interactions. The study highlighted the importance of monitoring and addressing preventable adverse drug reactions associated with oral anticoagulant therapy to improve patient safety and healthcare outcomes.
