The study investigated Clostridium difficile colonization in preterm neonates (PN) over a one-year period in a NICU. The findings showed a high colonization rate with non-toxigenic strains during hospitalization, predominantly RTs FR082 and 032. After discharge, there was an increase in diversity of non-toxigenic strains and emergence of toxigenic strains. PN with higher gestational age and birth weight had a higher colonization frequency. Toxigenic strains were isolated only after hospital discharge, belonging to RTs commonly found in infants and adults with C. difficile infections. The study suggests a potential hospital transmission of C. difficile strains and PN as a transient reservoir for pathogenic strains. The dynamics of colonization in PN followed a specific pattern, reflecting an acquisition of pathogenic strains from the community environment.
