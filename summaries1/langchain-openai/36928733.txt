The text discusses myoepithelioma and myoepithelial carcinoma of the head and neck mucosal and organ sites, along with the pertinent differential diagnoses that should be considered and excluded through histology, histochemistry, immunohistochemistry, and potentially molecular studies. Myoepithelioma is a rare benign salivary gland neoplasm composed entirely of myoepithelial differentiated cells, while myoepithelial carcinoma is the malignant counterpart with invasive growth. The differential diagnoses include various benign and malignant salivary gland tumors, soft tissue neoplasms, melanoma, carcinoma, and plasmacytoma. The importance of a logical, stepwise algorithmic approach to the differential diagnosis, combined with a targeted immunohistochemistry evaluation, is emphasized to accurately diagnose and differentiate these challenging lesions. Additionally, the significance of considering a broad spectrum of epithelioid and spindled cell tumors that could mimic myoepithelial tumors is highlighted, along with the importance of interpreting immunohistochemistry results and considering invasive growth for a carcinoma diagnosis. Selected molecular studies may be added for therapeutic options or differences in management when necessary.
