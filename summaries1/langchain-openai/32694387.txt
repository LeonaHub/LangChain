The text discusses the process and considerations involved in revising the definition of pain by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP). The IASP Task Force, formed in 2018, deliberated on proposed modifications to the existing definition of pain, considering feedback from experts, philosophers, and the global pain community. The revised definition emphasizes pain as an aversive sensory and emotional experience associated with tissue injury, or resembling such injury. The notes accompanying the definition highlight the subjective nature of pain, its distinction from nociception, and the multifaceted influences on pain perception. The task force addressed concerns regarding terminology, the role of tissue injury in pain, and the inclusion of nociplastic pain syndromes. The revised definition aims to encompass the complexity of chronic pain conditions and align with advancements in pain research and patient care, particularly in the context of the ICD-11 classification. The final recommendations, approved by the IASP Council, reflect a commitment to ongoing updates in line with evolving knowledge in the field of pain.
