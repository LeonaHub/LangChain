The text discusses a study conducted in Japan focusing on the impact of treatment cost on the decisions made by physicians and patients regarding the treatment of Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) and transplant-ineligible Multiple Myeloma (MM). The study found that while treatment cost did not significantly affect most patients, a portion of CML and MM patients received non-optimal treatment due to cost considerations. Specifically, 10-20% of CML patients and 2-4% of transplant-ineligible MM patients may undergo non-optimal treatment because of treatment cost. Factors such as patient age, occupation status, household composition, treatment duration, and internet use were identified as influencing patient decisions related to treatment cost. The study highlighted that treatment cost considerations were more prevalent for CML patients compared to MM patients. The research also indicated that physician recommendations and patient adherence to treatment dosing were influenced by treatment cost, particularly in later lines of therapy. The study emphasized the importance of understanding the impact of treatment cost on treatment decisions and the need for further research to explore these dynamics among physicians and patients.
