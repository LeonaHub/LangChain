The study investigated the impact of incorporating instructional techniques that enhance intrinsic motivation (IM) into a computer-based arithmetic learning program for adults with schizophrenia. The motivational approach included presenting learning materials in a meaningful context, personalizing material into themes of high interest value, and offering choices to increase control over the learning process. Results showed that the group receiving motivation-enhancing instructions made greater gains in arithmetic skills, reported higher levels of IM and perceived self-competency, and showed improvements in attention compared to the group without motivational elements. The study suggests that people with schizophrenia respond positively to motivational instructional techniques, and beliefs of self-competency and autonomy are key determinants of IM. The findings highlight the importance of incorporating motivational strategies in cognitive remediation programs for individuals with schizophrenia.
