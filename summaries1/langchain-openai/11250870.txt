The study investigated the role of P2X receptors and α-adrenoceptors in mediating sympathetic control of arterial tone in rat mesenteric arteries of different sizes. The findings revealed that small and medium arteries predominantly rely on P2X receptors for contraction, while large arteries primarily use α-adrenoceptors. The study also showed that calcium influx through P2X receptor channels is the main mechanism for contraction, with minimal contribution from L-type voltage-gated calcium channels or calcium-induced calcium release. The results suggest that P2X receptors could be potential targets for hypertension treatment, as they are resistant to common antihypertensive therapies.
