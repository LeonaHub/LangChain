The study investigated the effects of insulin-induced hypoglycemia (IIH) on pulsatile luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion in estrogen-primed ovariectomized rats. It was found that IIH suppressed LH secretion by decreasing the electrical activity of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulse generator. Glucose was able to reverse this suppression and restore pulsatile LH secretion, suggesting a critical role for glucose in maintaining GnRH neuron activity. Other carbohydrates like fructose, galactose, xylose, and lactate did not have the same rapid effect as glucose, indicating a unique role for glucose in synaptic function. Mannose, which behaves similarly to glucose and can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, also showed a restorative effect on LH secretion. The study concludes that glucose availability, rather than just metabolic state, is essential for maintaining the activity of the GnRH pulse generator and pulsatile LH secretion.
