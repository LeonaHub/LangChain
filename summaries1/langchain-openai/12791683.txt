The text discusses a study comparing the interaction of full-length human TATA-binding protein (TBP) with promoter DNA to that of yeast TBP. The study focuses on the binding affinity, kinetics, and bend angle induced by human TBP on the adenovirus major late promoter (AdMLP) consensus sequence. The results show that human TBP rapidly binds and bends the promoter DNA, forming a stable complex with a larger bend angle compared to yeast TBP. The study challenges a recent model proposing a slow DNA bending mechanism for human TBP, highlighting differences in binding kinetics and bend angles between the two proteins. The findings suggest variations in the recognition mechanisms of human and yeast TBPs, emphasizing the importance of detailed comparative studies using identical experimental conditions.
