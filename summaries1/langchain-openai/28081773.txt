The text discusses the complex relationship between bone marrow adiposity and bone health, focusing on the energy needs and metabolic processes of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), osteoblasts, and adipocytes within the bone marrow niche. It explores the bioenergetics of these cells, highlighting the distinct metabolic requirements for adipocytic and osteoblastic differentiation. The review delves into clinical scenarios where marrow adiposity plays a role, such as in osteoporosis, anorexia nervosa, obesity, diabetes, Cushing's syndrome, HIV, and lipodystrophy. Various intervention studies targeting bone health, including estrogen, bisphosphonates, parathyroid hormone, and exercise, are discussed in relation to their effects on marrow fat. Mechanisms underlying the reciprocal relation between bone and marrow fat, involving transcription factors like Runx2 and PPARg, as well as other factors like Zfp467, Sclerostin, and RANKL, are explored. The text also touches upon the challenges in identifying the origin and markers of marrow adipocytes, as well as the need for further research to understand the link between lineage allocation, metabolic homeostasis, and potential therapeutic implications for obesity and osteoporosis.
