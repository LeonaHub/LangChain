The text discusses a study conducted on patients with drug-resistant epilepsy who were implanted with the RNS System, a neurostimulation device, to examine the effects of brain-responsive neurostimulation on sleep. The study involved PSG monitoring of six subjects to assess the relationship between RNS System stimulations and arousals during sleep. The results indicated that RNS System stimulations did not disrupt sleep and that arousals tended to peak before stimulations, suggesting that the stimulations did not cause arousals. The study highlighted the need for larger studies to further investigate the effects of neurostimulation on sleep and to understand the mechanisms underlying these effects for the development of improved devices with better side effect profiles.
