The text discusses the risk assessment and management implications of Pine Wilt Disease (PWD) caused by the Pine Wood Nematode (PWN) in China. The study developed a comprehensive risk assessment framework for PWD, considering the introduction pathways, establishment, and dispersal risks of the PWN. Multiple introduction pathways for PWN in China were identified, including source countries and entry ports. The study found that PWN overlaps with its hosts primarily in southern, central, and northeastern China, with different insect vectors playing a role in different regions. Climate change is projected to increase the threat of PWN to hosts in northeastern China by expanding suitable habitats for the nematode and its vectors. The study emphasizes the importance of strengthening early warning and prevention measures, particularly in high-latitude regions, to mitigate the risks associated with PWN establishment and dispersal. The framework developed in this study provides valuable insights for evaluating and managing the risks associated with PWD and could serve as a reference for developing comprehensive risk schemes for invasive alien species.
