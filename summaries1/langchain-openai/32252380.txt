The text discusses the use of high-strength steel sandwich panels in lightweight high-speed vehicles and the challenges faced in welding the T-joints of these structures. It introduces the flux bands constricting arc (FBCA) welding method as a solution to the limitations of traditional laser welding methods. The study explores the effect of flux bands on arc behavior, arc shape, arc heat, metal transfer, and arc stability in FBCA welding compared to traditional gas metal arc welding (GMAW) in ultra-narrow gap grooves. The results show that flux bands have a solid-wall constricting effect on the arc, stabilizing its burning position and shape. The flux bands also regulate the heat distribution and metal transfer, leading to improved arc stability and reduced fluctuations in voltage and current. Overall, the flux bands effectively enhance the welding process in ultra-narrow gap grooves, providing a more stable and efficient method for welding high-strength steel sandwich panels.
