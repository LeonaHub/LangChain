The study focused on using Functional Respiratory Imaging (FRI) parameters to predict forced vital capacity (FVC) decline in patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). Data from a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating an anti-CTGF monoclonal antibody for IPF treatment was retrospectively analyzed. FRI parameters, including airway radius, fibrotic tissue percentage, and lobe volume, were assessed for correlation with FVC decline. Lower lung zones were found to be more affected, with FRI parameters showing sensitivity to changes in disease progression. The study highlighted the potential of FRI in monitoring regional changes in IPF and capturing disease progression, especially in patients with preserved FVC.
