The text discusses the synthesis and characterization of oligosaccharide-based block copolymers (BCPs) with high immiscibility and small domain sizes for nanopatterning applications. The study focuses on the effect of electrostatic interactions at charge-modified BCP interfaces on self-assembly and nanostructure orientation. The researchers utilized CuAAC click chemistry to create triazole junction points and n-alkylated triazolium+/counteranionâ€“ junctions to enhance BCP self-assembly. The results show that the charge-modified BCPs exhibit unidirectional lamella (Lam) nanostructure formation in thin films, guided by ionic nanochannels. The study highlights the importance of solvent vapor annealing (SVA) and optimized film thickness in promoting long-range ordered BCP structures. The findings demonstrate the potential for utilizing electrostatic interactions to control BCP domain alignment and open avenues for advanced nanopatterning and ionic transport applications.
