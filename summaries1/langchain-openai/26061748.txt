The study utilized the Connectivity Map (C-MAP) algorithm to identify potential therapeutic agents for medulloblastoma, focusing on Group 3 tumors. The top 200 differentially expressed genes in medulloblastoma subgroups were used to query the C-MAP database, leading to the identification of alsterpaullone (ALP) as a promising compound for Group 3 medulloblastomas. In vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed the efficacy of ALP in reducing cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis, and improving survival in mouse xenograft models. ALP was found to down-regulate cell cycle-related genes, including MYC, and reverse the gene expression profile of Group 3 medulloblastoma cells. Statistical analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier estimates, log-rank tests, and GraphPad Prism 5 Software, with a significance level set at p < 0.05.
