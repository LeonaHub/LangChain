The text discusses the structural mechanisms of Raf autoinhibition and activation, focusing on B-Raf in the presence and absence of the 14-3-3 dimer. It explores the roles of phosphorylated sites, pSer365 and pSer729, and the interactions between RBD-CRD and KD in maintaining the autoinhibited state. The simulations reveal stable interactions in the presence of the 14-3-3 dimer, with CRD playing a significant role. Removal of pSer365 or RBD-CRD triggers structural changes in KD, leading to potential dimerization. In the absence of the 14-3-3 dimer, RBD-CRD interactions can block KD dimerization, suggesting a mechanism for B-Raf autoinhibition. The study proposes that Raf isoforms may share similar autoinhibition and activation mechanisms, providing insights for drug discovery targeting Raf activation.
