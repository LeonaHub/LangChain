The text discusses the molecular characteristics and functional implications of the γ chain variants of human plasma fibrinogen, specifically focusing on the γ50 and γ57.5 chains. It describes the heterogeneity in molecular weight and amino acid sequence differences at the C-terminus of these chains. The study investigates the role of the γ57.5 chain in platelet-fibrinogen interactions and its impact on platelet aggregation.

Key findings include:
- The γ55 chain is a post-translational modification of the γ57.5 chain, with differences in C-terminal amino acids.
- The γ57.5 chain is expressed in hepatocytes but not in megakaryocytes.
- The C-terminal extension of fibrinogen γ57.5 affects platelet aggregation, with differences in binding compared to γ50.
- Synthetic peptides and monoclonal antibodies were used to study the binding and inhibitory effects on platelet function.
- The L2B epitope was localized to residues R-409-PEH-412 on the γ57.5 chain.
- The secondary structure and hydrophobicity of the γ57.5 chain were predicted to be different from the γ50 chain.
- The γ57.5 C-terminus is exposed in fibrin clots, supporting its role in hemostatic events.

Overall, the study provides insights into the structural and functional differences between γ50 and γ57.5 chains of fibrinogen, highlighting the importance of the C-terminal region in platelet-fibrinogen interactions and hemostasis.
