The text discusses a series of studies that aimed to evaluate the impact of social comparison information on physical activity levels in sedentary adults using Fitbit challenges. The studies employed within-subject, single-case experimental designs to assess changes in daily steps during baseline, challenge, and return to baseline phases. Participants competed against active and sedentary confederates in Fitbit challenges, with results showing variability in the effects of exposure to different levels of performance. Factors such as order of exposure, distance between participant and confederate steps, and individual differences influenced the outcomes. The studies highlighted the importance of considering individual and situational factors in the context of social comparison and competition to understand their impact on physical activity levels. Limitations included variability in syncing frequency, potential inaccuracies in step measurements, and the need for long-term follow-up to assess sustained effects. The findings suggest that Fitbit challenges may be effective in increasing physical activity, but the outcomes may vary based on individual characteristics and challenge conditions. Further research is needed to explore the factors influencing the effectiveness of social comparison interventions in promoting physical activity.
