The text discusses the role of eosinophils in inflammatory conditions like bronchial asthma, focusing on the IL-5/IL-5Rα axis and the therapeutic implications of targeting eosinophils in severe eosinophilic asthma. It explains the factors influencing eosinophil differentiation, maturation, and survival, including the effects of cytokines like IL-5, IL-3, and GM-CSF. The text delves into the mechanisms of action of the anti-IL-5Rα monoclonal antibody, benralizumab, which inhibits IL-5 binding and induces eosinophil depletion through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. It also addresses concerns about the safety of eosinophil-depleting therapies, particularly regarding potential impacts on parasitic infections, viral defense, tumor immunology, and autoimmune responses. The conclusion emphasizes benralizumab's unique dual mechanism of action and its overall safety profile in targeting eosinophils in eosinophilic asthma.
