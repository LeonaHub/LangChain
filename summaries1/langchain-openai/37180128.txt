The study investigated the impact of body mass index (BMI) on residual beta-cell function in children with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes. The research found that higher BMI at diagnosis was associated with higher C-peptide levels initially, but over a two-year follow-up period, there was a significant decrease in C-peptide levels, along with an increase in daily insulin requirement and HbA1c, particularly in children with the highest BMI. This suggests that higher BMI negatively affects residual beta-cell function in the long term. The study also explored the relationship between BMI, inflammatory cytokines, and autoimmune markers in type 1 diabetes. The findings indicated that higher BMI was associated with elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, which may contribute to beta-cell exhaustion. The study highlighted the importance of maintaining a healthy BMI to preserve beta-cell function in children with type 1 diabetes and suggested the need for further research and therapeutic strategies to address this issue.
