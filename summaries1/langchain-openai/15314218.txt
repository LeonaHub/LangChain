The text discusses a study on the folding of apomyoglobin (apoMb) and the effects of substitutions at position 131 on the stability of the protein in its intermediate (I) and native (N) forms. The study focuses on determining whether specific side-chain packing interactions or hydrophobicity play a dominant role in stabilizing the I form of apoMb. Various substitutions at position 131 were made, including overpacking, underpacking, and polar substitutions, and their effects on stability were analyzed through urea-induced unfolding transitions monitored by CD and fluorescence spectroscopy. The results suggest that hydrophobic interactions, rather than specific side-chain packing, are the primary contributors to the stability of the I form of apoMb. Overpacking substitutions at position 131 increased stability, indicating a lack of rigid side-chain packing interactions in this region. The study also examined the effects of substitutions on the N form of apoMb, revealing multistate unfolding transitions and a complex interplay between side-chain hydrophobicity and structural plasticity. The findings challenge previous interpretations and suggest that the I form of apoMb resembles a molten globule conformation with a significant reliance on hydrophobic interactions for stability. Further research is needed to explore specific packing interactions in other regions of apoMb.
