The text discusses a study on the renal toxicity of InP/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) with various surface modifications in mice. The study involved characterizing the QDs, administering them to mice, and analyzing their effects on kidney function through various parameters. The results showed that the QDs accumulated in the kidneys but did not cause significant histological changes. However, they induced oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in the renal tissues. Different surface modifications of the QDs led to varying levels of toxicity. The study highlights the importance of surface modifications in reducing the toxicity of QDs for potential biomedical applications.
