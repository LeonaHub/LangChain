The text discusses a study on the effects of the neonicotinoid pesticide clothianidin on bumblebees, specifically queen, worker, and male Bombus impatiens. The study found that chronic oral exposure to clothianidin at field-realistic concentrations had differential effects on the survival of the bumblebee castes and sexes. Queens and males showed reduced survival rates at specific intake rates, while workers were better able to cope with the pesticide. The study also delved into the genomic responses of workers and males to sub-lethal clothianidin doses, identifying genes associated with various biological functions, including reproduction and detoxification. The findings suggest that chronic exposure to clothianidin can impact bumblebee populations by affecting reproductive capacity and mating dynamics. The study highlights the importance of considering queen and male survival in pesticide risk assessments and proposes using genomic approaches to develop tools for assessing neonicotinoid exposure levels and sub-lethal effects on wild bee populations.
