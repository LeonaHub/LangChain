The text discusses the implementation of the HIGHway project, which aims to improve advance care planning (ACP) for patients undergoing dialysis. The project builds upon the previous SDM-RSC intervention and involves training social workers or nurses in ACP, supporting them through a 9-month action period, and utilizing a dedicated web-based application to guide ACP conversations. The project involves collaboration with dialysis organizations, recruitment of social workers/nurses, and engagement of stakeholders. The implementation timeline includes training cohorts, monthly coaching calls, and data collection. The project focuses on implementation outcomes, patient/provider outcomes, and data collection methods. The goal is to routinize ACP and make it a regular part of care for dialysis patients. Addressing barriers and involving stakeholders are key strategies in the project's success.
