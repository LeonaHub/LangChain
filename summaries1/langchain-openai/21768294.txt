The text discusses the therapeutic potential of FTY720 in treating NK-cell leukemia, focusing on its mechanisms of action in inducing apoptosis in leukemic NK cells. The study found that FTY720 triggers apoptotic cell death in leukemic NK cells through two main mechanisms: degradation of the prosurvival protein Mcl-1 via lysosomal pathway and altered sphingolipid metabolism leading to accumulation of proapoptotic sphingosine. The research also highlights the unique targeting of Mcl-1 by FTY720, distinct from survivin targeted by ceramide therapeutics. Additionally, the study suggests that combining FTY720 with ceramide nanoliposome therapy may have additive/synergistic effects on leukemic NK cells, warranting further investigation in animal models of NK-cell leukemia.
