The text discusses the importance of mucosal immunity in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting the role of BAFF/APRIL cytokines and homeostatic chemokines like CXCL13, CCL19, and CCL21 in promoting B-cell responses, antibody production, and the formation of inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT) following respiratory viral infections. Studies have shown elevated levels of these molecules in response to viral infections, including COVID-19, suggesting their potential as predictive markers for disease severity. The formation of iBALT has been linked to enhanced immune responses and protection against viral infections in animal models. Furthermore, mucosal vaccination strategies, such as intranasal vaccines, have shown promise in inducing local and systemic immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. The text proposes using BAFF/APRIL or CXCL13 as adjuvants in mucosal vaccines to enhance the local mucosal immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection.
