The study investigated the association between Haemophilus influenzae and bacterial conjunctivitis, acute otitis media, and acute bacterial paranasal sinusitis in children. A total of 67 children were included, with H. influenzae being the most prevalent pathogen. The study identified a potential "conjunctivitis-otitis media-sinusitis syndrome" with H. influenzae as the main etiology. The antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed high resistance rates to ampicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate. The study highlights the importance of understanding these associations for appropriate antibiotic treatment and the need for effective vaccines against H. influenzae infections.
