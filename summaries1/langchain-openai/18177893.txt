The text discusses the identification and characterization of cadmium-responsive genes, specifically the CDR gene family, in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The study focuses on three members of the CDR family: CDR-1, CDR-4, and CDR-6. These genes are involved in responding to cadmium exposure and potentially play a role in osmoregulation. The genes exhibit similarities in structure, cellular expression patterns, and loss-of-function phenotypes, suggesting they may have redundant biological functions. The transcription of CDR-4 and CDR-6 is affected by various environmental stressors, while CDR-1 is specifically induced by cadmium. The genes are expressed in intestinal and pharyngeal muscle cells, with CDR-4 and CDR-6 being targeted to lysosomes. Inhibition of CDR-4 and CDR-6 expression leads to fluid accumulation in C. elegans, indicating a disruption in osmoregulation. The study also suggests that the CDR family may be unique to lower organisms, with potential orthologs in other invertebrates. Further research is needed to understand the precise biological functions and regulatory mechanisms of the CDR genes.
