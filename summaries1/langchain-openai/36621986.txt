The study conducted at a tertiary hospital in Queensland, Australia, analyzed 171 patients who underwent ileostomy formation procedures. The research focused on readmission rates within 60 days of discharge, renal function changes, and electrolyte imbalances associated with ileostomy formation. The findings revealed a high readmission rate of 38%, with dehydration being a common cause. Patients who were readmitted showed a decrease in renal function, particularly in eGFR, compared to those who were not readmitted. Serum sodium levels at baseline were associated with an increased risk of readmission. While there were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between readmission and no readmission groups, there were observed changes in albumin, total protein, sodium, and urea levels over time. The study highlights the importance of monitoring renal function and electrolyte balance in patients with ileostomies to prevent complications and readmissions.
