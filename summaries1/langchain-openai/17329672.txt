The paper discusses the Complexity Account of Treatment Efficacy (CATE) in the context of treating lexical semantic deficits in individuals with fluent aphasia. It focuses on semantic complexity within the organization of semantic categories and its relevance to naming deficits in aphasia. The paper proposes a complexity hierarchy based on item typicality, where atypical examples are more complex than typical examples due to their core and distinctive features. The study presents results of experiments showing that training atypical items leads to generalization to typical items, but not vice versa. Factors influencing treatment success include patient variables, stimulus/task-specific variables, and the treatment protocol. The paper also discusses the clinical relevance of generalization to untrained items and the implications of the complexity hierarchy for treatment efficacy in aphasia. Further research is needed to explore semantic complexity in the treatment of naming deficits in aphasia.
