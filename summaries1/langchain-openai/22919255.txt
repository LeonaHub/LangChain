The text discusses a systematic review and meta-analysis conducted to investigate the association between three XRCC1 gene polymorphisms (Arg194Trp, Arg280His, and Arg399Gln) and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The study included data from 11 studies involving 2075 HCC patients and 2604 control subjects. The results indicated that the Arg194Trp polymorphism was not a risk factor for HCC. For the Arg280His polymorphism, while the His/His genotype showed a significant association with increased HCC risk, sensitivity analysis did not support this association. The meta-analysis did not strongly support the association between the His/His genotype of XRCC1 Arg280His polymorphism and increased HCC risk. Additionally, the Arg399Gln polymorphism was not found to be associated with HCC risk, consistent with previous findings. The study highlighted the need for further research with larger populations and different ethnicities to clarify these associations. Overall, the XRCC1 Arg194Trp and Arg399Gln polymorphisms were not linked to HCC risk, and more rigorous studies are required to understand the involvement of the XRCC1 Arg280His polymorphism in HCC susceptibility. No publication biases were found in the analysis of these polymorphisms.
