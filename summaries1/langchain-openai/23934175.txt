The study investigated the association of cMYC expression with clinical and pathologic variables in human diffuse gliomas. The research found that cMYC nuclear protein levels were correlated with mutant IDH1 (R132H) expression and strong p53 co-expression in malignant gliomas. Additionally, cMYC expression was more frequent and intense in anaplastic astrocytomas compared to glioblastomas and low-grade gliomas. The study also explored the relationship between cMYC expression, mRNA levels, and DNA copy number alterations in gliomas. Results showed that cMYC mRNA expression was higher in IDH1-R132 mutants, and cMYC amplification was associated with IDH1 mutations. Furthermore, cMYC expression was linked to reduced time to malignant transformation in IDH1 (R132H) mutants. The study suggested that cMYC may be an adverse prognostic factor in IDH1 mutant gliomas. However, the clinical significance of cMYC expression needs further investigation, considering other prognostic factors in gliomas. Future research should focus on evaluating the prognostic value of cMYC expression at different levels and stratifying by IDH1 mutation status and WHO grade.
