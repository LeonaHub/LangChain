The text discusses the impact of aging on neuronal properties and synaptic function in Aplysia, a marine snail. It highlights the decline in neuronal excitability and synaptic strength during aging, leading to sensory and motor deficits, and memory loss. The study focuses on the role of L-glutamate (L-Glu) in activating excitatory currents in tail sensory neurons (SN) and how aging affects this response. It also explores the involvement of serotonin (5-HT) in modulating SN excitability and synaptic transmission, crucial for non-associative learning in the tail withdrawal reflex (TWR).

The research findings indicate that aging impairs the normal 5-HT-mediated enhancement of SN excitability, but this impairment can be partially restored by activating protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathways. The study involved whole-cell voltage clamp recordings of isolated SN and intracellular recordings in semi-intact
