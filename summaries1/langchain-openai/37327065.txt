The text provides an overview of a scoping review conducted to assess the use of Early Warning Scores (EWS) for prehospital identification of sepsis. The review included 23 studies that demonstrated inconsistent performance of EWS in identifying prehospital sepsis. The experts consulted highlighted the challenges of relying solely on EWS for sepsis identification and suggested a combination of standardized protocols, clinical judgment, and sepsis education for effective prehospital care. They also proposed exploring new areas of research, such as incorporating vital signs or biomarkers like end-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring. Limitations of the review were discussed, including the need for more high-quality data and standardized definitions of sepsis. The conclusion emphasizes the importance of focusing on standardized prehospital care and interventions for acutely unstable patients with suspected infection, rather than relying solely on EWS for sepsis identification. Future research should evaluate the impact of these interventions on patient outcomes.
