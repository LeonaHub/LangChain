The text discusses the use of Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) measures in survivors of high-grade glioma, the challenges and potential of using these measures, and the importance of integrating them into clinical trials and clinical practice. PRO measures, such as HRQoL instruments and symptom assessment tools, are crucial for assessing the impact of treatment on patients' quality of life and symptom burden. While there are limitations to using PRO measures in patients with high-grade glioma, such as cognitive and neurologic disorders affecting self-reporting, efforts are being made to develop more precise and relevant measurement tools. The integration of PRO measures into survivorship care can improve communication between patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers, leading to better symptom management and quality of care. Overall, the use of PRO measures in high-grade glioma patients has the potential to enhance patient outcomes and survivorship care.
