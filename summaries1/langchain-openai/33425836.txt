The text discusses the implementation and outcomes of a blog launched by a psychiatric clinic in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The blog aimed to support patients with chronic psychiatric disorders during lockdown by providing daily content from various therapeutic professions. The blog received positive feedback from patients, but there were challenges in patient involvement and feedback collection. Despite reaching a considerable number of patients, the blog faced limitations in sustaining active reader engagement. The clinic's staff, who operated the blog, returned to full-time work after lockdown, leading to a halt in blog development. The text emphasizes the importance of developing low-threshold telehealth interventions for psychiatric patients during public health crises like the Covid-19 pandemic.
