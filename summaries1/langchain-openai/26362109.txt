The text discusses the structural and mechanistic advances in bacterial nitrate reductases, focusing on membrane-bound and periplasmic nitrate reductases. Crystal structures of these enzymes have provided insights into their catalytic mechanisms, revealing the coordination of molybdenum and sulfur atoms in the active site. The revised coordination sphere of molybdenum has led to a new understanding of the reaction mechanism, involving substrate binding directly to the Mo atom. The proposed mechanism, known as the S-shift, has been supported by theoretical studies and experimental evidence. These findings highlight the importance of crystallographic data and technological advancements in understanding the function of nitrate reductases in the cellular nitrogen cycle. Despite significant progress, there are still challenges and opportunities for further research in this area.
