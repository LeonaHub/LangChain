The text discusses the impact of measurement errors on surface texture parameters analyzed using optical methods. It highlights the sensitivity of various parameters to errors such as the presence of additional valleys and repetitive measurements. The study found that different parameters react differently to errors, with changes depending on the type of surface and the size of the error. The research emphasizes the importance of proper measurement procedures to minimize variations in surface texture parameters. The study is limited to surfaces measured optically, and future research will explore the impacts of other types of measurement errors.
