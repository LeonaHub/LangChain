The text discusses a systematic review on the effects of supplementing infant formula with probiotics Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 (B lactis) and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) on the growth of healthy infants. The review included multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating weight gain, length gain, head circumference gain, and BMI in infants fed formula with probiotics compared to those fed unsupplemented formula. The results showed no significant differences in growth parameters between the probiotic-supplemented and unsupplemented groups for B lactis. Limited data on LGG showed mixed results, with one trial suggesting better growth with LGG supplementation. The review highlighted methodological limitations in the studies, including small sample sizes, high dropout rates, and variable quality of reporting. The text also mentions the importance of considering protein content in infant formula and the need for further research on the impact of probiotic supplementation on infant growth. Overall, the review concludes that B lactis supplementation does not significantly impact infant growth, while more research is needed on the effects of LGG supplementation.
