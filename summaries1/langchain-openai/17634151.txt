The text discusses the biases in tree reconciliation methods used to study gene gain and loss in evolutionary genomics. It explains how errors in gene tree inference can lead to overestimation of gene duplications near the root of the species tree and an overestimation of losses across the tree. The study conducted reconciliations with varying bootstrap cut-offs and found that decreasing cut-offs led to increased duplications on non-informative branches and increased losses across all branches. The text also highlights discrepancies between gene duplication estimates from tree reconciliation methods and likelihood methods. It discusses implications for vertebrate genome evolution studies and suggests improvements in reconciliation methods to address biases and uncertainties in inferring gene gain and loss patterns accurately.
