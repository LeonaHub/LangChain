The text discusses a rare case of Kawasaki Disease (KD) in an adult following COVID-19 vaccination with the Vaxzevria vaccine. KD is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by vasculitis and systemic symptoms. The patient experienced atypical KD symptoms, including liver involvement, coagulopathy, and acute kidney injury. The case highlights the importance of monitoring and reporting adverse events following immunization (AEFI) to ensure vaccine safety and effectiveness. The prompt detection and evaluation of new information on vaccine side effects are crucial for maintaining public trust in vaccination programs. Despite rare occurrences of AEFI, the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks, especially during a global pandemic. The case underscores the need for continued vigilance in monitoring vaccine safety and addressing rare adverse events promptly.
