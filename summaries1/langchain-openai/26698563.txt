The text discusses a rare case of a hepatic falciform ligament clear cell myomelanocytic tumor (CCMMT), which belongs to the PEComa family of tumors. The case study involves a 29-year-old woman with liver cancer rupture, leading to surgical intervention. The diagnosis was confirmed through pathological examination and immunohistochemistry, showing characteristic features of CCMMT. The text delves into the differential diagnosis, imaging manifestations, pathological characteristics, and biological behavior of CCMMT. Treatment options, including surgical excision and potential use of mTOR inhibitors, are also discussed. The importance of long-term follow-up and the need for further research in the diagnosis and treatment of CCMMT are highlighted. The study was approved by the Ethic Committee, and written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication.
