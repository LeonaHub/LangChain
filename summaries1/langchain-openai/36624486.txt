The study investigated the association between walking pace, handgrip strength, and the risk of new-onset dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia. The research, conducted on a large sample size from the UK Biobank, found that individuals with faster walking pace and higher handgrip strength had a lower risk of dementia. The study also revealed that the association between walking pace and dementia risk was influenced by factors such as age and APOE Îµ4 dosage. The findings suggest that assessing physical function, genetic profile, and age together can help in identifying individuals at risk of dementia. The study emphasizes the importance of considering these factors in dementia risk assessment and prevention strategies.
