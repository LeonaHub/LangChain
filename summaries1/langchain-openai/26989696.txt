The text discusses the potential cardioprotective effects of curcumin against high glucose-induced cardiac injury in cardiomyocytes. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with an increased risk of heart failure, with diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) being a major complication characterized by structural and functional cardiac disorders. Studies have shown that cardiomyocyte apoptosis and oxidative stress play key roles in the pathogenesis of DCM. Curcumin, a compound derived from turmeric, has been shown to have antioxidant properties and potential cardioprotective effects.

In the study, primary cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were exposed to high glucose levels to mimic diabetic conditions. Curcumin treatment was found to increase cell viability, reduce the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and aspartate amino transferase (AST), and inhibit cardiomyocyte apoptosis induced by high glucose. Curcumin also decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in cardiomyocytes.

Furthermore, curcumin was shown to inhibit the expression of NADPH oxidase isoforms, which are involved in ROS production, and activate the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β signaling pathway. The activation of this pathway was associated with the inhibition of high glucose-induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. The study suggests that curcumin may be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of diabetic cardiomyopathy by reducing oxidative stress, preserving Akt and GSK-3β phosphorylation, and inhibiting NADPH oxidase-mediated ROS production.
