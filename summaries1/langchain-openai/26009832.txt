The text discusses an analysis conducted as part of the HPTN 052 study, which aimed to evaluate predictors of adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV-1 infected individuals offered treatment for HIV prevention. The study involved HIV-1 serodiscordant couples in various countries who were randomized to early ART initiation. Adherence was measured through pill counts and self-report questionnaires, with factors such as mental health, geographic region, and social support being examined as predictors of adherence. The analysis found that higher mental health scores were associated with better adherence, and adherence was generally high in the study population. The study suggests that adherence to ART for prevention purposes may differ from adherence to ART for treatment, and highlights the importance of counseling, feedback, and support in optimizing adherence to ART for HIV prevention.
