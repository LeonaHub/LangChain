The text discusses the role of the adiponectin system in regulating reproductive functions in females. Adiponectin, an adipocyte-derived hormone, is involved in energy metabolism and has been found to play a crucial role in various reproductive organs and processes. Adiponectin and its receptors are expressed in structures such as the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, ovaries, reproductive tract, embryos, and placenta. The hormone influences steroidogenesis, prostaglandin synthesis, and cell proliferation in these organs, impacting processes like oocyte maturation, embryo development, and trophoblast invasion. Adiponectin's effects on the reproductive system are influenced by the hormonal status of the individual, with implications for conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome and implantation failures. Overall, adiponectin acts as an important hormonal regulator in the female reproductive system, modulating various processes during the menstrual/oestrous cycle and pregnancy.
