The text discusses a case report of a Japanese woman with Lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI) who presented with renal tubular acidosis (RTA)/Fanconi syndrome and rickets in childhood. Despite lacking typical LPI symptoms like protein aversion and hyperammonemia, genetic analysis revealed a homozygous nonsense variant of SLC7A7, confirming the diagnosis. The patient exhibited various kidney abnormalities, including tubular and glomerular changes, with evidence of immune abnormalities resembling systemic lupus erythematosus. The study highlights the importance of considering LPI in patients with renal tubular diseases, even in the absence of classic symptoms, and the utility of comprehensive genetic analysis in diagnosing such cases. The authors declare no conflicts of interest, and the study was conducted in accordance with ethical standards and informed consent protocols.
