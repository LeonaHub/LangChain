The study investigated the association between COVID-19 infection and the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients undergoing diagnostic testing for VTE in a healthcare system in Sweden during the first 3 months of the pandemic. The study included a cohort of 8702 patients who underwent VTE testing, with 88 confirmed cases of COVID-19. The results showed no significant difference in the prevalence of VTE between COVID-19 positive, negative, or untested patients in 2020 compared to previous years. COVID-19 did not increase the odds for VTE when adjusting for known risk factors, indicating that conventional risk stratification tools can be used. The prevalence of VTE was lower in COVID-19 patients seen in the outpatient and admission groups, but higher in ICU patients with COVID-19. The study suggests that COVID-19 status should not influence pretest probability for VTE in the emergency department. The results indicate that COVID-19 did not increase the risk of VTE in patients undergoing diagnostic testing for VTE during the early months of the pandemic in Sweden.
