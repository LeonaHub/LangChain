The text discusses a study conducted in Norway from 2005 to 2015, focusing on breast cancer subtypes among immigrant women. The study included over 3 million women aged 20-75 years, with a focus on immigrants from various regions compared to non-immigrants. The study analyzed breast cancer subtypes based on hormone receptor status and HER2 expression, finding differences in subtype distribution among immigrant groups. Luminal A-like subtype was most common overall, with variations in other subtypes across regions. Immigrants from high-income countries had similar breast cancer incidence rates as non-immigrants, while women from Eastern Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia had lower rates of luminal A-like subtype. Asian women had higher rates of HER2+ tumors. TNBC rates were similar across groups, except for women from South-East Asia. The study suggests that differences in breast cancer subtypes among immigrant groups are influenced by various factors including genetics, lifestyle, health care access, and screening practices. The findings highlight the importance of considering immigrant status and country of birth in cancer outcomes and planning preventive strategies.
