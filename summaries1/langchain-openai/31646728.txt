The text discusses a qualitative study that explored the expectations of patients who are not members of patient and family advisory councils (PFACs) regarding these councils. The study focused on the importance of the "who" aspect, emphasizing the significance of who represents patients on PFACs and how they are chosen. Participants expressed a desire for transparency, diversity, and communication between PFACs and the broader patient population. The study highlighted the potential impact of PFACs on patient satisfaction, trust in the healthcare system, and the need for PFACs to be trustworthy and effective in their roles. Recommendations included increasing awareness of PFACs, ensuring diversity in membership, facilitating communication channels, and evaluating PFAC effectiveness. The study concluded that PFACs have the potential to improve patient-centered care and enhance patients' views of healthcare systems.
