The text describes a study conducted to investigate the resistance of Venturia effusa, the causal agent of pecan scab, to the demethylation-inhibiting (DMI) fungicide tebuconazole. The study evaluated field sensitivity of V. effusa to DMI fungicides in pecan orchards in Georgia, finding widespread resistance to tebuconazole. In vitro sensitivity assays confirmed high resistance levels in isolates from different locations. The study aimed to determine the mechanism of resistance by analyzing mutations in the CYP51A and CYP51B genes and assessing gene expression levels. Novel mutations (G444D, G357H, I77T, I77L) were identified in the resistant isolates, along with increased gene expression. The study involved DNA extraction, sequencing of CYP51A and CYP51B genes, and gene expression analysis using qPCR. Data analysis included statistical methods to compare treatment efficacy and gene expression levels. The findings suggest that newer DMI fungicides like difenoconazole and mefentrifluconazole remain effective against V. effusa, while tebuconazole resistance is a significant concern in pecan orchards. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of fungicide resistance in V. effusa and highlights the importance of monitoring and managing resistance in commercial pecan production.
