The study focused on the effects of Trypsin-Chymotrypsin (Chymoral Forte D.S.) on burn patients, specifically looking at the modulation of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-6. The research involved administering the drug to burn patients and monitoring changes in serum cytokine levels, particularly IL-1β and IL-6, using ELISA kits. The results showed that the drug treatment led to a decrease in cytokine levels, accelerated wound healing, and improved scar outcomes compared to untreated control patients. The study highlighted the potential of Trypsin-Chymotrypsin in reducing burn oedema, inflammation, and cytokine activity, ultimately promoting better outcomes in burn wound healing. The findings suggest that the drug may have anti-inflammatory effects and could be beneficial in managing burn injuries.
