The study focused on evaluating the prognostic role of various bladder cancer markers, including survivin, CD68, CLEVER-1, MAC387, KRT5, KRT20, and ERBB2, in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. The research aimed to assess the clinical usefulness of these markers in predicting outcomes and guiding treatment decisions. The study included 50 MIBC patients who underwent radical cystectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Various markers were analyzed using immunohistochemistry and PCR methods. The results indicated that high levels of survivin and BIRC5 mRNA were associated with better outcomes in MIBC patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. Additionally, macrophage infiltration, particularly in tumors with high proliferative activity or elevated ERBB2 mRNA expression, was linked to worse disease-specific survival. The study highlighted the potential of these markers in predicting chemotherapy benefit and guiding treatment decisions in MIBC patients. Further prospective studies with larger sample sizes are recommended to validate these findings and enhance patient stratification for tailored therapeutic interventions.
