The study conducted on participants from the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS) cohort aimed to estimate the lifetime risk (LTR) of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and examine the impact of various risk factors on CVD incidence. The study included 10,222 individuals and found that the LTR of CVD was higher in men compared to women at both index ages of 20 and 40 years. The presence of individual risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, smoking, and hypercholesterolemia was associated with an increased LTR for CVD. Additionally, the study revealed that the cumulative effect of multiple risk factors further elevated the LTR of CVD, with women showing a more pronounced impact of risk factors on CVD risk compared to men. The study also highlighted the importance of maintaining optimal risk factor levels to prolong CVD-free survival and reduce the incidence of premature CVD. The findings suggest that early prevention strategies targeting risk factors may help reduce the burden of CVD in both men and women.
