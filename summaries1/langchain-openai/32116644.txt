The text discusses the role of electrophile signaling in the central nervous system (CNS) and its relevance to neurodegenerative diseases. It highlights the development of high-throughput chemoproteomics methods, such as T-REX and G-REX, to profile potential LDE sensors at low occupancy and probe on-target LDE signaling. The discussion extends to the involvement of electrophile signaling in multiple sclerosis (MS), particularly focusing on the Keap1/Nrf2/antioxidant response pathway. The text also delves into the use of dimethyl fumarate (DMF) in MS treatment, exploring its molecular targets and downstream effects. Various targets/pathways implicated in DMF's mechanism of action, such as Keap1/Nrf2, PKCθ, GAPDH, HCA2, p65, IκBα, and RSK/MSK kinases, are examined. The text also touches on the relevance of LDE signaling in stress defense, aging, and
