The study investigated the effects of transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) paired with notched music therapy for treating refractory chronic tinnitus in 30 patients. The treatment involved applying tVNS using a patch-type electrode on the left auricular concha while patients listened to notched music. Results showed improvements in subjective tinnitus severity, loudness, and awareness in a significant number of patients. The treatment was found to be safe, with no specific side effects observed. The study suggests that tVNS paired with notched music therapy may be a promising non-invasive treatment option for refractory chronic tinnitus, although further research is needed to confirm its effectiveness and optimal parameters.
