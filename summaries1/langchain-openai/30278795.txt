Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis (IPH) is a rare disorder in children characterized by recurrent episodes of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. This study reviewed 107 pediatric IPH cases over 21 years, highlighting the challenges in diagnosis and treatment. The classic triad of hemoptysis, anemia, and pulmonary infiltrates was not always present, leading to high misdiagnosis rates. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis was crucial for confirming pulmonary hemorrhage. Glucocorticoids were the main treatment, with favorable responses in most cases, although recurrence rates were high during tapering. Early recognition and appropriate immunosuppressive therapy were key in improving prognosis and prolonging survival in children with IPH.
