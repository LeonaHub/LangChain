The text discusses the genetic analysis of the Abyssinian pea (Pisum sativum ssp. abyssinicum) to determine its origin and relationship to other Pisum taxa. The study analyzed alleles from 18 genes in various Pisum accessions, including P. fulvum, P. sativum, and P. elatius. The results indicate that the Abyssinian pea shares closer genetic relationships with P. sativum and P. elatius than with P. fulvum, suggesting a potential hybridization event between P. sativum and P. elatius. The study also explores the genetic diversity, domestication traits, and taxonomic considerations within the Pisum genus. The findings suggest that the Abyssinian pea may have originated from a P. sativum Ã— P. elatius hybridization, possibly from Asia Minor, and raises questions about its independent domestication status. Further research is needed to understand the evolutionary history and genetic relationships of the Abyssinian pea within the Pisum genus.
