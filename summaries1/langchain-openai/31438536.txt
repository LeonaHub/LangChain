The text discusses the identification and characterization of a novel invertase inhibitor protein, Zm-INVINH4, in maize (Zea mays L.). The study involved the cloning and expression of Zm-INVINH4, demonstrating its inhibitory activity on both cell wall and vacuolar invertases. The research also investigated the spatial and temporal expression patterns of Zm-INVINH4 in maize tissues under drought and ABA stress conditions. Functional assays, including transient expression in potato leaves, confirmed the inhibitory role of Zm-INVINH4 on invertase activity. The study suggests that Zm-INVINH4 may modulate invertase-related source-to-sink growth and development in maize under drought stress. Additionally, the text details the experimental methods used, including RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, plasmid cloning, gene expression analysis, protein extraction, invertase activity determination, and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) analysis. Statistical analysis was conducted using Student's t-test for the experimental data.
