The study investigated the effects of heart failure on the gut-blood barrier and the levels of trimethylamine (TMA) and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) in the plasma. Spontaneously hypertensive heart failure (SHHF) rats showed structural and functional alterations in the intestinal wall, leading to increased levels of TMA and TMAO in the plasma. The study found that heart failure disrupted the gut-blood barrier, allowing for increased penetration of TMA from the gut into the systemic circulation. This was evidenced by higher levels of TMA and TMAO in the plasma of SHHF rats compared to Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats. The study also evaluated tight junction proteins in the intestines, showing altered expression levels in SHHF rats. Additionally, the study examined metabolic and kidney parameters, cardiovascular parameters, intestinal blood flow, and histopathological changes in the heart and lungs of the rats. The findings suggest that increased gut permeability to toxic bacterial metabolites like TMA may serve as a marker and mediator of cardiovascular pathology in heart failure. The study utilized various methods such as metabolic and hemodynamic measurements, ELISA tests, RNA isolation, RT-qPCR, protein extraction, immunoblotting analysis, and histopathological evaluation to assess the impact of heart failure on the gut-blood barrier and plasma levels of TMA and TMAO. Data analysis was conducted using statistical tests to determine significant differences between the experimental groups.
