The text discusses a meta-analysis and systematic review conducted in Ethiopia to estimate the prevalence of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and its associated factors among survivors of trauma. The study identified 13 relevant articles and found a pooled prevalence of PTSD among adults in Ethiopia to be 39.28%. Factors associated with PTSD included poor social support, being female, having a previous mental illness, and witnessing traumatic events. The study highlighted the importance of social support in preventing PTSD and emphasized the need for interventions to support individuals exposed to traumatic events, particularly those with risk factors for developing PTSD. The study also acknowledged limitations in the number of articles included and the lack of specificity in age groups and gender prevalence in the primary studies. Overall, the findings underscore the significance of addressing PTSD in Ethiopia and providing targeted support to those at risk.
