The text discusses a study conducted in Thailand to determine factors influencing COVID-19 preventive behaviors among the population. The study utilized the PRECEDE model and analyzed data from 6,521 participants who completed an online survey. Factors such as social support, age, flu-like symptoms, gender, perceived risk of exposure, lockdown policy, and residential area were found to influence COVID-19 preventive behaviors. Social support was identified as the most influential factor. The study highlighted the importance of understanding individual characteristics, predisposing factors, enabling factors, and reinforcing factors in promoting COVID-19 preventive behaviors. The results indicated that further research is needed to explore how different variables impact the adoption of preventive behaviors and to develop tailored strategies to reduce the spread of COVID-19.
