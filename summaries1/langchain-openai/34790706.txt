The study focused on evaluating the plasma levels of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) in long-distance runners before and after intense exercise, specifically a marathon race, and its association with left atrial (LA) remodeling. The research involved 36 Caucasian male competitive long-distance runners divided into high-training and low-training groups, along with a control group. The findings indicated that highly trained runners had elevated sVCAM-1 levels compared to moderately trained and physically active individuals. The study also revealed a correlation between sVCAM-1 levels and LA volume, suggesting sVCAM-1 as a potential biomarker for assessing adverse effects on LA structure and function in high-performance athletes. Further research is needed to validate these findings and explore the predictive value of sVCAM-1 for atrial fibrillation risk in athletes.
