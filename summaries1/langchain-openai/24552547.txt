The text discusses a study that investigated the effects of the environmental chemicals bisphenol A (BPA) and genistein on the rat serum proteome. The study aimed to identify proteins affected by lactational exposure to these chemicals and assess their potential as biomarkers of susceptibility to carcinogenesis. Using TMT-MS analysis, the study identified differentially expressed proteins in the sera of rats exposed to BPA and genistein during the prepubertal period. The results showed alterations in protein expression associated with carcinogenesis, apoptosis, and tumor suppression. Western blot analysis validated the changes in protein expression identified by TMT-MS. The study highlights the potential of quantitative proteomics via TMT-MS as a reliable technique for identifying molecular targets and biomarkers of susceptibility to environmental chemicals. The findings provide insights into the mechanisms of action of BPA and genistein in breast cancer risk and suggest the importance of studying the rat serum proteome as a reference for future human studies.
