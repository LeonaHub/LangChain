The text discusses the evaluation of the antitumor activity of Amblyomin-X in pediatric anaplastic Ependymoma (EPN) primary culture and an intracranial xenograft model. EPN cells were treated with Amblyomin-X, showing cytotoxic effects while preserving normal cell viability. Flow cytometry confirmed apoptosis induction in EPN cells. Ultrastructural analysis revealed various alterations in EPN cells treated with Amblyomin-X. In vivo studies using a xenograft model showed tumor regression with Amblyomin-X treatment, confirmed by MRI and histological analysis. The study highlights the selective antitumor potential of Amblyomin-X in EPN cells, suggesting its candidacy as a therapeutic agent. Ethical considerations and detailed methodologies for cell culture, animal experiments, and imaging techniques were also described.
