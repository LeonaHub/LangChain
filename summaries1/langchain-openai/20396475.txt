The text discusses the potential neuroprotective effects of indole β-carbolines, harmalol, and harmine, as well as R-(-)-deprenyl, on differentiated PC12 cells exposed to S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine (SNAP)-induced toxicity. The study investigates the impact of these compounds on mitochondrial dysfunction, cytochrome c release, ROS formation, GSH depletion, caspase-3 activation, and cell viability in the context of Parkinson's disease-related neuronal cell death. Results indicate that β-carbolines and R-(-)-deprenyl can mitigate SNAP-induced cell death by preserving mitochondrial function, reducing ROS levels, and maintaining GSH content. Harmalol and harmine, at concentrations of 25 µM, show significant protective effects without causing cytotoxicity, suggesting their potential as neuroprotective agents against nitrogen species-induced neuronal injury. The study highlights the importance of further research on the levels and effects of indole β-carbolines in the body and their potential as therapeutic agents for neuroprotection in Parkinson's disease.
