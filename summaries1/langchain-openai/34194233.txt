The text discusses the issue of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in a Romanian infectious diseases hospital from 2016 to 2020. The study focused on ESKAPE pathogens, including Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella spp., Acinetobacter spp., Pseudomonas spp., and Enterobacter spp. The study found varying levels of resistance among these pathogens, with MRSA and ESBL being significant concerns. The pandemic year of 2020 saw a reduction in the number of isolates analyzed, with some pathogens showing increased resistance rates. The study highlights the importance of accurate microbiological diagnosis, adherence to European antimicrobial susceptibility testing standards, and the need for updated protocols for antibiotic prescription to combat AMR effectively.
