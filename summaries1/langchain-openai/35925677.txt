The text discusses the isolation and characterization of two metabolites, truncatenolide and truncatenone, from the culture filtrates of the soybean pathogen Colletotrichum truncatum in Argentina. Truncatenolide exhibited phytotoxic and antifungal activity against soybean pathogens, while truncatenone showed stimulatory effects on seed root growth. Truncatenolide demonstrated total growth inhibition of Cercospora nicotianae, a soybean pathogen, and comparable activity to known nonenolides against other fungal pathogens. The study highlights the potential of truncatenolide and modiolide A as antifungal agents, emphasizing the importance of further research to explore their fungicidal properties.
