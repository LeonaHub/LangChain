The text discusses a study conducted in urban China on the vitamin A (VA) nutritional status of lactating women. The study found that a small proportion of lactating women met the recommended nutrient intake (RNI) for VA, with nearly one-fifth having lower breast milk retinol concentrations than recommended. Overweight, obese, and multiparous women were found to have a worse VA nutritional status. The study also revealed a positive association between dietary VA intake and serum VA concentrations, particularly in women not using VA supplements. However, there was no significant association between serum and breast milk retinol concentrations. The study highlights the importance of adequate VA intake for lactating women and the need for further research on factors influencing VA nutritional status in this population.
