The text discusses the relationship between primary and secondary metabolism in Streptomyces bacteria, focusing on the trigger of antibiotic biosynthesis. The study explores the role of TAG metabolism in antibiotic production, particularly in the context of the ppk mutant strain of S. lividans TK24. The disruption of the ppk gene leads to an energetic deficit, triggering TAG degradation and generating precursors for antibiotic biosynthesis. Proteomic analysis of the ppk mutant indicates active TAG degradation, suggesting a link between TAG metabolism and antibiotic production. The study proposes a model where TAG degradation in the ppk mutant strain contributes to antibiotic biosynthesis and high endogenous oxidative stress. This novel understanding sheds light on the concomitant biosynthesis of peptide and polyketide antibiotics and provides insights for future antibiotic discovery strategies.
