The text discusses the role of PAR2 (Protease-Activated Receptor 2) promoter methylation in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) progression. Through bioinformatics analysis, it was found that PAR2 promoter hypomethylation is associated with increased PAR2 gene expression and poor prognosis in LUAD patients. Experimental validation in LUAD cell lines confirmed elevated PAR2 expression and hypomethylation of the promoter. Treatment with a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor increased PAR2 expression and promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. The study highlights the potential of PAR2 promoter methylation as a biomarker for LUAD progression and suggests further research to identify specific methylated sites for targeted therapeutic interventions.
