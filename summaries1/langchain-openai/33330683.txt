The study evaluated the selectivity of water buffaloes for four tree species commonly used in silvopastoral systems: Leucaena leucocephala, Albizia lebbeck, Gliricidia sepium, and Moringa oleifera. The research found that buffaloes preferred A. lebbeck and L. leucocephala leaves over G. sepium and M. oleifera. A. lebbeck contributed the most to the protein needs of buffaloes, covering all their requirements. The study highlighted the importance of understanding buffaloes' preferences for different tree leaves in tropical production systems and suggested further research on the effects of secondary metabolites on feed intake.
