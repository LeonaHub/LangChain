The study focused on the use of intravenous dipyridamole during exercise in patients undergoing myocardial single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to improve diagnostic accuracy. Patients who were unable to achieve a sufficient peak heart rate and oxygen consumption during exercise testing were administered dipyridamole. The results showed that the simultaneous administration of dipyridamole during exercise significantly improved the diagnostic yield of myocardial SPECT without compromising important prognostic data obtained from maximal subjective exercise tests. This combined approach enhanced sensitivity and negative predictive value, leading to better outcomes in patients with inadequate exercise tests. The vasodilation induced by dipyridamole during exercise resulted in improved myocardial perfusion imaging quality and reduced side effects. The study suggested that systematic dipyridamole administration during exercise testing could be beneficial in patients unable to achieve optimal exercise levels, allowing for the integration of clinical and ECG information with optimized SPECT results.
