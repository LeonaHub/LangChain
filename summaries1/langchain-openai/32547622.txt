The text discusses a retrospective study conducted at Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital in Ghana over a three-year period to review data on animal bites and rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). The study included 1030 participants, with a higher proportion of animal bites observed in children compared to adults. Dog bites were the most common, occurring mainly at home. Delays in initiating PEP were noted, with 11.7% starting treatment after a week. Efforts to enforce dog immunization at home were suggested to reduce rabies exposure. The study highlights the importance of public health interventions to prevent human rabies, especially in children, and emphasizes the need for improved patient counseling and compliance with PEP schedules. Further research on rabies incidence post-prophylaxis and factors influencing delays in seeking treatment is recommended.
