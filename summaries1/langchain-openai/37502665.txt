The text describes a study conducted to evaluate the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of an adenovirus-based COVID-19 vaccine expressing the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 with an autophagy-inducing peptide C5 (AIP-C5) in mice and golden Syrian hamsters. The study involved immunizing the animals with the vaccine and assessing humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, including antibody levels, T cell responses, and virus neutralization. Additionally, the animals were challenged with a SARS-CoV-2 variant to evaluate vaccine efficacy in terms of morbidity, viral titers, and lung pathology. The study also included histopathological analysis of lung tissue to assess the impact of vaccination on reducing SARS-CoV-2-induced lesions. The results indicated that the vaccine induced robust immune responses and provided protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, with the HAd-Spike/C5 vaccine showing slightly better efficacy compared to HAd-Spike, although not statistically significant. The study was conducted in compliance with biosafety regulations and ethical guidelines, and statistical analyses were performed to determine significance.
