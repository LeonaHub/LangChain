The text discusses the molecular mechanisms involved in the transcriptional repression mediated by FOXP3 in regulatory T cells. It highlights the association of FOXP3 with histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), specifically TIP60, HDAC7, and HDAC9, in regulating gene expression. The study demonstrates that TIP60 promotes FOXP3 acetylation, which is essential for its transcriptional repression activity. Knockdown of TIP60 relieves FOXP3-mediated repression, indicating the importance of TIP60 in this process. The text also explores the dynamic ensembles of FOXP3 with HAT/HDAC complexes and their role in regulating IL-2 production in T cells. Additionally, it discusses the disruption of the FOXP3-HDAC9 complex by T cell receptor stimulation, which can be restored by HDAC inhibitor treatment. The findings suggest potential pharmaceutical approaches to modify regulatory T cell functions by targeting the enzymatic activity of HATs or HDACs.
