The study examined the correlation between air pollutants and spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) in Taiwanese patients using big data analysis. Data from the National Health Insurance Research Database and government open data were integrated. The study found correlations between sICH and pollutants such as CO, NO2, PM10, and PM2.5, with age being a modulating factor. PM2.5 and PM10 were identified as significant risk factors for sICH in middle-aged and elderly patients. The study suggested that air pollution control policies and cut-off levels may need adjustment based on the findings. Limitations included differences in pollutant detection locations and time frames. Further research is needed to understand the impact of air pollutants on sICH more precisely.
