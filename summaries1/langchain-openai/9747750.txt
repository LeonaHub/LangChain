The text discusses a case of Sheehan's syndrome, a pituitary necrosis following postpartum hemorrhage. The patient experienced acute symptoms post-delivery, including severe headache and polyuropolydypsic syndrome. Initial differential diagnoses included pituitary apoplexy, necrosis of a silent pituitary adenoma, and lymphocytic hypophysitis. MRI imaging revealed an enlarged pituitary gland with a distinctive peripheral rim, consistent with pituitary ischemia. The patient was managed conservatively with hormone replacement therapy. The text emphasizes the importance of considering Sheehan's syndrome in cases of an enlarged non-hemorrhagic pituitary gland post-delivery, as early diagnosis can impact treatment decisions
