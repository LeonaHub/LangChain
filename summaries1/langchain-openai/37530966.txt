The text discusses the role of Delta-like ligand 4 (Dll4) in mediating long-term vascular dysfunction following radiation injury. The study utilized consomic rat models with reduced Dll4 expression to investigate the impact of Dll4 on survival and vascular function post-radiation exposure. Through non-invasive 2nd window NIR imaging, the study demonstrated that Dll4-low rats had improved survival and reduced vascular injury compared to Dll4-high rats. The findings suggest that decreased endothelial Dll4 expression plays a role in protecting against radiation-induced vascular injury. The study also highlighted the dynamic regulation of Dll4-Notch signaling in response to radiation and injury, indicating Dll4 as a potential therapeutic target for mitigating vascular remodeling post-radiation. Further research will focus on understanding the acute changes in lung vascular endothelium at the single-cell level.
