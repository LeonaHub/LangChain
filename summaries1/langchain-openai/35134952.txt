The text discusses Haldane's Rule, which states that in hybrid offspring of different animal races, the heterogametic sex (i.e., the sex with different sex chromosomes) tends to show reduced fitness, leading to rarity, sterility, or absence. This rule has been observed in birds, where females are the heterogametic sex. The text explores various explanations for Haldane's Rule, such as dominance theory and the "Large X-effect." It also discusses studies that have investigated introgression rates of different genetic loci in birds, with most studies supporting Haldane's Rule. However, exceptions to the rule have been found, such as cases involving sex-biased dispersal and ancient introgression events. The text highlights the importance of understanding the life history and behavior of species in interpreting introgression patterns. It also notes the limited use of genomic approaches to directly estimate introgression rates and suggests future research directions to explore introgression patterns across the genome, including the study of W-linked loci.
