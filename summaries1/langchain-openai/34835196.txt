The text discusses the development of a double-antibody sandwich ELISA for detecting the major capsid protein (MCP) antigen concentration in inactivated Infectious Spleen and Kidney Necrosis Virus (ISKNV) vaccines. Monoclonal antibodies against ISKNV were generated and used in the ELISA assay, which showed high sensitivity, convenience, and accuracy in detecting antigen concentrations. The ELISA method proved to be more effective than conventional techniques, detecting a higher number of positive samples. The MCP protein, being a key protective antigen in ISKNV, was expressed and purified for use as a standard in the ELISA. The assay successfully correlated antigen content with viral titers in inactivated vaccines, demonstrating its reliability and potential for quality assessment in ISKNV vaccines. Overall, the double-antibody sandwich ELISA provides a sensitive and specific method for quantitatively determining antigen quality in inactivated ISKNV vaccines.
