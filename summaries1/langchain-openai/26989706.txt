The study investigated the impact of asthma on Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) expression in peripheral blood and sputum leukocytes. It was found that asthmatics had lower levels of soluble TLR2 (sTLR2) in serum and sputum compared to healthy subjects. Additionally, TLR2 mRNA expression in sputum leukocytes was significantly lower in asthmatics. The findings suggest that the humoral and cellular environment in asthmatic lungs may down-regulate TLR2 expression. Further research is needed to determine the role of sTLR2 in asthma severity and its potential as a marker for disease progression.
