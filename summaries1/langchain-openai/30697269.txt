The study investigated the role of miR-210 and its target PTPN2 in the development of pre-eclampsia (PE). It was found that miR-210 expression increased under hypoxia, promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in trophoblast cells. PTPN2, a target of miR-210, suppressed these effects via the PDGFR-Akt pathway. The study suggests that miR-210 and PTPN2 could serve as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for PE. However, limitations include small sample size, lack of in vivo validation, and incomplete understanding of the miR-210 mechanism in the PDGFR-Akt pathway, necessitating further research.
