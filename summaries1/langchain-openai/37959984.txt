The study focused on the long-term outcomes of poly(Îµ-caprolactone) (PCL) grafts in rat abdominal aorta replacements 180 days post-implantation. Three main histological reactions were observed: graft encapsulation, chronic inflammation, and scaffold degradation with remodeling. All implants exhibited intimal hyperplasia and subintimal mineralization, with some showing S 100 positive cells indicating chondroid metaplasia. Grafts without inflammation remained stable and patent, while those with persistent inflammation were stenotic. The study highlights the importance of understanding cell differentiation in the remodeling of artificial vascular prostheses and the need for further research into these mechanisms.
