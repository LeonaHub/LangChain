The study aimed to evaluate the expression of epithelial growth factors, apoptosis-regulating proteins, and cell proliferation markers in periapical granulomas (PGs) and periapical cysts (PCs) at different stages of development. The research found that CD57+ cells were present in approximately half of the lesions, with a higher frequency in lesions with moderate/intense inflammatory infiltrates. Bcl-2 expression did not vary significantly among the groups. EGF and KGF expression were more common in PCs than in PGs, suggesting a role in stimulating epithelial cell proliferation. EGFR expression did not correlate with any parameters evaluated. Ki-67 expression was limited in the epithelial lining of PCs, with no significant differences among the groups. The study concluded that EGF and KGF expression in PCs, along with the presence of CD57+ cells in lesions with intense inflammatory infiltrates, may influence the development of inflammatory periradicular lesions.
