The text discusses a systematic review (SR) that aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of lifestyle modifications, nonpharmacologic interventions, and psychological interventions in improving outcomes for patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The review included studies on physical activity, diet, smoking cessation, mud bath therapy, and other interventions. The review found limited evidence supporting the effectiveness of these interventions in PsA management. The studies included in the review had various limitations, such as heterogeneity in study designs, lack of high-quality evidence, and incomplete reporting. The review concludes that while there are known health benefits associated with healthy lifestyles, there is insufficient high-quality evidence to recommend specific lifestyle modifications or interventions for PsA. The review emphasizes the need for further research to determine the impact of lifestyle changes on PsA outcomes and to guide future care for patients with PsA.
