The study focused on Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) and investigated the role of Rho-GTPase-activating protein DLC-3 in tumor growth and invasion, particularly in relation to the Wnt signaling pathway. Clinical samples from TNBC patients were analyzed, showing DLC-3 downregulation in TNBC tissues. Overexpression of DLC-3 inhibited proliferation and colony formation of breast cancer cells, as well as suppressed their invasive ability. Additionally, DLC-3 was found to regulate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by upregulating GSK-3β and downregulating β-catenin and c-myc. The study suggests that DLC-3 may act as a tumor-suppressor gene in TNBC and provides a basis for further research on targeting DLC-3 in TNBC treatment.
