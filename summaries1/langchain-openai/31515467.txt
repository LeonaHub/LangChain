The study investigated the role of the circular RNA 0079993 (circ_0079993) derived from the POLR2J4 gene in colorectal cancer (CRC). The research found that circ_0079993 was significantly upregulated in CRC tissues and cell lines, correlating with poor prognosis. Knockdown of circ_0079993 inhibited CRC cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Circ_0079993 was shown to interact with multiple miRNAs, including miR-203a-3p.1, and regulate the expression of CREB1 by sponging miR-203a-3p.1. The study highlighted the ceRNA network involving circ_0079993, miRNAs, and CREB1 in CRC progression. The findings contribute to understanding CRC pathogenesis and suggest potential therapeutic targets, emphasizing the need for further research on the complex regulatory mechanisms involving circRNAs in CRC.
