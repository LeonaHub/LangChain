The study focused on examining the renal consequences of prolonged hyperglycemia in nonobese GK rats to understand the similarities to human diabetic nephropathy. The research extended the observation period and revealed functional and morphological progression in the kidneys of GK rats. The findings included increased glomerular hyperfiltration, defects in glomerular filtration, microalbuminuria, glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and inflammatory cell infiltration. The study demonstrated that prolonged hyperglycemia plays a crucial role in inducing progressive diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetes, with aging and obesity potentially exacerbating renal injury. Additional factors like hyperlipidemia and hypertension may further contribute to renal complications.
