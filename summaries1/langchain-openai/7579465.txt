The text discusses the activation of the src-related tyrosine kinase lyn in human neutrophils in response to various soluble and particulate agonists. Stimulation by chemotactic factors, cytokines, and phagocytic stimuli leads to a rapid increase in lyn autophosphorylation, indicating its involvement in signal transduction pathways. The specificity of lyn activation for tyrosine residues is confirmed through phosphoamino acid analysis. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate the transient tyrosine phosphorylation of lyn in response to different agonists. The activation of lyn is associated with increased tyrosine kinase activity and correlates with the stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation levels in neutrophils. The study suggests that lyn plays a pivotal role in the signal transduction mechanisms of neutrophils and contributes to the regulation of various physiological responses elicited by different agonists. The differences in lyn activation by various agonists indicate the involvement of distinct signaling pathways and kinases, highlighting the complexity of neutrophil responses to different stimuli. Further research is needed to fully understand the specific mechanisms and interactions of tyrosine kinases in neutrophil activation.
