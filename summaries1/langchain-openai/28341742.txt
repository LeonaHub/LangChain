The text discusses the regulation of acidification in early endosomes and its impact on the fusion of avian sarcoma and leukosis virus (ASLV) with cells expressing different receptor isoforms. It explores how cell-extrinsic factors, such as buffer pH, and cell-intrinsic factors, like IFITM3 expression, influence the kinetics and efficiency of ASLV fusion. The study uses single-virus imaging and bulk imaging assays to analyze the progression of ASLV entry and fusion in different cell types. It also examines the role of IFITM3 in inhibiting ASLV fusion and its effects on endocytosis and acidification of virus-carrying vesicles. The results suggest that both extracellular and intracellular factors play a role in modulating the fusion of ASLV with host cells.
