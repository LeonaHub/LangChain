The text discusses a study that investigated the relationship between obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) severity and dyslipidaemia in a large sample of patients. The study found a nonlinear, multistage relationship between OSA severity and dyslipidaemia, with complex patterns of lipid risk factors associated with different stages of OSA. The study used three indices (AHI, ODI, ArI) to quantify OSA severity and found that sleep fragmentation (ArI) was strongly associated with lipid risks. The results suggest that traditional linear models may not accurately capture the relationship between OSA and dyslipidaemia. The study highlights the importance of considering multiple risk factors and using innovative analytical approaches to understand the complex interactions between OSA and chronic diseases. The findings have implications for the management and treatment of dyslipidaemia in patients with OSA. Further research, including large-scale randomized controlled trials, is needed to confirm these results and explore potential interventions.
