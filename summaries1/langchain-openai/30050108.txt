The text discusses Phenylketonuria (PKU), an inborn error in phenylalanine metabolism, focusing on genotype-phenotype correlations in Chinese patients. A study of 1104 patients identified 203 mutations in the PAH gene, with p.R243Q being the most prevalent. Genotype analysis categorized patients into classic PKU, mild PKU, and mild hyperphenylalaninaemia. Homozygous and compound heterozygous genotypes were analyzed, revealing correlations with different PKU phenotypes. Functionally hemizygous genotypes were assessed for residual PAH activity and phenotype associations. Inconsistencies between predicted and observed phenotypes were noted, suggesting the influence of genetic modifiers. The study highlights the complexity of PKU phenotypes and the need for further research to understand genotype-phenotype correlations in Chinese populations. Ethical considerations, methodology, and data analysis methods are also detailed in the text.
