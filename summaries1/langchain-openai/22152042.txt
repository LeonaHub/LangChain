The text discusses the biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (SNPs) using Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as a model system. It highlights the differences in kinetics and size distribution of SNPs synthesized in vitro and in vivo, with in vivo synthesis being faster and resulting in larger nanoparticles. The involvement of various cellular proteins, including histone (H4), carbonic anhydrase, superoxide dismutase, and others, in the biosynthesis and capping of SNPs is elucidated. Protein depletion experiments confirm the direct role of these proteins in controlling the size and morphology of the synthesized nanoparticles. The study also includes spectroscopic and kinetic characterization of SNPs, SDS-PAGE analysis of SNPs-associated proteins, MALDI MS-MS analysis, and electron microscopic characterization of the biosynthesized SNPs. The findings suggest that the biosynthesis of SNPs is governed by a complex interplay of cellular proteins and other biomolecules present in the biological system.
