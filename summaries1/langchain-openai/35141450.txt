The text discusses a study on the effects of nandrolone decanoate (ND) treatment on the expression of aquaporin 1 (Aqp1) and aquaporin 9 (Aqp9) in different segments of the rat epididymis. The study involved ND treatment at different doses for 2 or 12 weeks and analyzed the transcript levels of Aqp1 and Aqp9 using quantitative real-time PCR. The results showed differential modulation of Aqp1 and Aqp9 expression in various epididymal segments by ND treatment, indicating segment-specific and dose-dependent regulation. The study suggests a complex regulatory mechanism of Aqp1 and Aqp9 in the epididymis by hormonal factors and proposes that aberrant expression of these aquaporins due to ND treatment could impact sperm development and potentially lead to ND-induced infertility. Further research is recommended to elucidate the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying these effects.
