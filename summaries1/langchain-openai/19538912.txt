The text discusses a study that evaluated the effectiveness of a University Assistance Program (UAP) for mandated college students with alcohol-related violations. The study compared the UAP intervention with services as usual (SAU) and assessed various outcomes over a 6-month period. Results showed that UAP was more effective in reducing weekday alcohol consumption, alcohol-related consequences, and increasing coping skills and protective behaviors compared to SAU. However, there were no significant differences in heavy episodic drinking or blood alcohol concentration between the two groups. The study highlighted the importance of addressing coping skills and protective behaviors in interventions with mandated students and suggested the need for additional or more intensive services to impact certain alcohol-related outcomes. Limitations of the study included self-reported data, lack of fidelity measures, and a relatively short follow-up period. The findings have implications for college programs for students with alcohol policy violations, suggesting that tailored interventions and cost-effectiveness studies are needed to improve outcomes for mandated students.
