The text discusses the importance of collagen, particularly from aquatic species like the soft-shelled turtle (SST), as an alternative to terrestrial animal-derived collagens due to safety and dietary restrictions. The study focuses on identifying specific peptide biomarkers in SST gelatin (STG) extracted from calipash for quality control purposes. Through PTM detection-based peptidomics analysis, seven specific peptide biomarkers from collagen type I (COL1) were identified and validated using LC-QQQ MS. The study also delves into the selection and verification of STG-specific peptide sequences, highlighting the importance of PTMs like hydroxylation and deamidation in collagen stability. A total of 74 peptides with different PTMs were identified, with eight peptides selected as STG-specific peptide biomarkers based on signal intensity and specificity. These synthesized peptide biomarkers were confirmed to exclusively detect STG samples, making them
