The text discusses the validation and psychometric properties of the Children's Eating Attitude Test (ChEAT) in a sample of Chinese children aged 9 to 13 years. The study involved 906 children from grades three to five in Shanghai, China. The ChEAT questionnaire, BMI measurements, and demographic information were collected to assess eating attitudes and behaviors. The study found that the Chinese version of the ChEAT demonstrated good reliability and validity in evaluating eating attitudes and behaviors in Chinese children. The ChEAT identified distinct factors related to eating behaviors, such as fear of getting fat, dieting and purging behaviors, bulimia and food preoccupation, and social pressure to eat. Gender differences were observed in eating behaviors, with girls showing more fear of getting fat and social pressure to eat. Additionally, correlations were found between ChEAT scores and BMI, with overweight girls exhibiting more eating disorder problems than normal-weight girls. The study highlights the importance of early detection of abnormal eating attitudes and behaviors in children and provides a valuable tool for screening and assessing eating disorders in Chinese children.
