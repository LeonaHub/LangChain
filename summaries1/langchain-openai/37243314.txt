The study investigated the impact of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals on the circadian clock and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in THP-1 macrophages, a model for gout flares. MSU crystals altered the expression of circadian clock components, with increased PER2 and CRY1, and reduced BMAL1 and REV-ERBα levels. BMAL1 and REV-ERBα were found to repress MSU crystal-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation. BMAL1 repressed pro-IL-1β and CASP1 expression, while REV-ERBα repressed NLRP3 expression. Time-of-day variations were observed, with BMAL1 levels influencing NLRP3 inflammasome activity, which was highest when BMAL1 levels were low. The study suggests that macrophages are more susceptible to inflammasome activation when BMAL1 levels are low, potentially contributing to the nocturnal pattern of gout flares. The findings highlight the role of circadian control in immune cell function and inflammation, with implications for understanding time-of-day variations in inflammatory responses in conditions like gout and renal colic.
