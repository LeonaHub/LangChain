The text discusses a study on ion fluxes in the pitchers of three Nepenthes species: Nepenthes ampullaria, Nepenthes bicalcarata, and Nepenthes rafflesiana. The study used the MIFE ion-selective electrode technique to measure NH4+ and H+ fluxes across the pitcher walls of these species. It also examined gland distribution and morphology in the pitchers. The results showed that each species had unique ion flux patterns and gland characteristics related to their nutrient sequestration strategies. N. rafflesiana had the highest NH4+ uptake rate, while N. ampullaria and N. bicalcarata actively controlled the pH of their pitcher fluids. The study also found surprising ion fluxes in zones covered with epicuticular waxes in N. rafflesiana, suggesting a potential primitive form of digestive glands in these zones. The findings shed light on the diverse strategies employed by these carnivorous plants for nutrient acquisition.
