The text discusses the correlation between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and fragility fractures in elderly patients, particularly those over 60 years old. A systematic review was conducted, including 17 studies with a total of 603,995 participants. The majority of studies concluded that elderly patients with T2DM are at an increased risk of fragility fractures, especially hip fractures. Various factors contribute to this increased risk, including the impact of T2DM on bone health, complications of the disease, and pharmacological treatments. The text highlights the multifactorial nature of the increased fracture risk in T2DM patients, including impaired bone quality, vascular supply to the skeleton, and cortical porosity. It also discusses the challenges in assessing fracture risk in T2DM patients and the importance of considering specific fracture risk factors and treatment strategies tailored to this population. Overall, the text emphasizes the need for further research and specialized care for elderly patients with T2DM to address the risk of fragility fractures.
