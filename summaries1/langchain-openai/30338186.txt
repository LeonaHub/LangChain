The study investigated the clinical application of the IllumiScan fluorescence visualization device for detecting oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and leukoplakia, comparing it with other screening methods such as Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) and the Iodine Staining Method (IOM). The IllumiScan device was found to be useful in distinguishing between cancer and normal areas, with high sensitivity and specificity for OSCC and leukoplakia. However, it may face challenges in accurately identifying lesion areas in keratinized mucosa. The study suggests that combining the IllumiScan device with other screening methods could lead to a more accurate diagnosis of oral mucosal lesions.
