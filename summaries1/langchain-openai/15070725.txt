The text discusses the role of Arg-522 in the T7 replicative DNA helicase encoded by bacteriophage T7 and its importance in coupling dTTP hydrolysis and DNA unwinding activities. The study involved in vitro mutagenesis of Arg-522 to alanine or lysine, resulting in altered gene 4 proteins (gp4-R522A and gp4-R522K). The findings indicate that the substitution of Arg-522 affects dTTP hydrolysis and DNA unwinding activities, with gp4-R522A showing uncoupling of these activities while gp4-R522K retains some degree of coupling. Vi inhibits both dTTPase and DNA-unwinding activities, and the altered proteins exhibit decreased dTTPase activity. The study also highlights the cooperative nature of subunits in the hexamer and the essential role of Arg-522 in mediating conformational changes for translocation on ssDNA. The inability of gp4-R522K to support T7 DNA polymerase-catalyzed strand displacement synthesis underscores the importance of minimal DNA-unwinding activity for DNA synthesis. Overall, the results suggest that Arg-522 plays a crucial role in nucleotide binding, conformational changes, and coupling of dTTP hydrolysis and DNA unwinding activities in the T7 gene 4 helic
