The study focused on optimizing the extraction of polysaccharides and antioxidant activities from brown macroalgae using hydrothermal-assisted extraction (HAE) and sequential ultrasound and thermal technologies. The research aimed to maximize the yields of fucose, total glucans, and antioxidant activities from Laminaria hyperborea, Laminaria digitata, and Ascophyllum nodosum. Response surface methodology was employed to optimize HAE variables, and the results were applied to the other macroalgae species. The recovery of fucose and total glucans varied significantly among the species, with A. nodosum showing the highest fucose recovery and L. hyperborea showing the highest total glucan recovery. Principal component analysis highlighted the need for different extraction approaches for fucose and total glucans. Further studies are required to purify and characterize the obtained polysaccharides fractions.
