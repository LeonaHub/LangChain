The text discusses the importance of selecting peer leaders in school-based interventions to optimize behavior change. It highlights the effectiveness of peer-led interventions in reducing health behavior problems among adolescents and young adults. The study focuses on the selection of peer leaders in a school-based suicide prevention program and examines various theoretical selection methods. These methods include Peer Opinion Leaders, Friendship Network Opinion Leaders, Key Players, and Hybrid Methods. The study evaluates the sociometric and demographic characteristics, clustering, representativeness, and proximity to at-risk students of peer leader sets produced by these methods. The findings suggest that network-informed selection methods can improve the diversity and network position of peer leader sets, potentially enhancing intervention diffusion. The study also explores the relationship between selection concordance and intervention diffusion, indicating that certain selection methods may be more effective in reaching students with different modalities of intervention exposure. The text concludes by suggesting a hybrid approach that combines respected opinion leaders with strategically placed key players for optimal intervention diffusion. Future research is recommended to implement these selection methods and observe their impact on intervention diffusion in schools.
