The text discusses the synthesis and biological evaluation of ω-hydroxy polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) derived from arachidonic acid (ARA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Specifically, the focus is on 20-HETE, 20-HEPE, and 22-HDoHE, which are metabolites of these PUFAs. The synthesis of these compounds involved challenging steps such as partial hydrogenation of triple bonds. In vivo studies in rats showed that 20-HETE induced pain, while 20-HEPE and 22-HDoHE did not. In vitro studies revealed that 20-HEPE and 22-HDoHE activated TRPV1 more than 20-HETE. The findings suggest that ω-3 hydroxy metabolites may have therapeutic potential due to their TRPV1 activation without inducing pain, unlike 20-HETE. The practical synthesis of these ω-hydroxy PUFAs provides a valuable tool for further research into their biological roles.
