The study focused on the genetic mutations, specifically BRAF V600E and TERT promoter mutations, in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) to determine their impact on prognosis and guide the choice between lobectomy (LT) and total thyroidectomy (TT) as initial surgical approaches. The research involved 685 patients with PTC, revealing that TERT promoter mutations were significantly associated with worse outcomes, while BRAF V600E mutation alone did not show a significant impact. Patients with TERT promoter mutations, especially when coexisting with BRAF V600E mutations, had poorer cause-specific survival and disease-free survival rates. The study suggested that for patients with 1â€“4 cm intrathyroidal PTC without TERT promoter mutations, lobectomy could provide outcomes similar to total thyroidectomy. The findings highlight the potential of genetic markers to guide surgical decisions and reduce overtreatment in PTC patients, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing postoperative complications.
