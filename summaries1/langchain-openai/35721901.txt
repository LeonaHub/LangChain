The text discusses the synthesis, characterization, and application of a luminescent molybdenum cluster, [Mo6Cl14]2–, for sensing nitroaromatic compounds, specifically trinitrotoluene (TNT). The molybdenum cluster was synthesized efficiently and characterized using various analytical techniques. The study focused on the quenching of the cluster's fluorescence by TNT, with the Stern–Volmer equation used to describe the quenching behavior. Experimental and theoretical methods were employed to analyze the interaction between the molybdenum cluster and TNT, revealing significant contributions of TNT in the active lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals involved in higher intensity transitions. The results showed promising potential for using the molybdenum cluster as a sensor for detecting nitroaromatic explosives, with the need for further evaluation of sensor selectivity in real-world applications.
