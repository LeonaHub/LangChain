The text describes the development of a chronic cranial window with an access port using a silicone plug, allowing for repeated injections, functional imaging, and electrophysiological recordings in the brains of mice. The device simplifies surgical procedures, maintains imaging quality, and enables easy access to the brain for various manipulations. The technique was successfully used for repeated dye injections, functional imaging, and whole-cell patch clamp recordings in mice. The device offers a cost-effective and efficient way to reduce the number of animals used in research while increasing the depth of information gained from each individual animal. It opens up new possibilities for in vivo drug screening, cellular manipulation, and electrophysiological studies in neuroscience.
