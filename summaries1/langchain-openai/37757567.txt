The text discusses the importance of cardiac arrest (CA) as a leading cause of mortality and the significance of ventricular fibrillation (VF) as an initial rhythm during CA. It highlights the critical role of early high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in improving survival outcomes. The study focuses on analyzing the electrical and mechanical activities of the cardiovascular system during CPR after CA using cross recurrence quantitative analysis (CRQA). The experiment was conducted on pigs, and ECG and PPG signals were recorded during Baseline, CA, CPR, and recovery of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) periods. The results showed distinct patterns in the electrical and mechanical dynamics across the different stages of CPR. The study revealed changes in recurrence rate, determinism, entropy, and trapping time in ECG and PPG signals, indicating alterations in the electrical-mechanical coupling during CPR. The findings suggest that analyzing the electrical-mechanical coupling using CRQA could serve as a functional indicator for evaluating CPR progress and prognosis. The study emphasizes the potential of this approach in improving CPR quality and outcomes.
