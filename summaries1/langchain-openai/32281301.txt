The text discusses a study on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients who underwent neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) followed by surgery. The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of FDG PET/CT parameters in assessing treatment response and predicting prognosis in PDAC patients. The study found that PERCIST and SUVmax were superior to RECIST in determining the therapeutic effect of NAT on PDAC. The reduction rate of metabolic tumor volume (MTV) was identified as an independent prognostic factor for recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). Patients with >50% reduction in MTV had significantly longer RFS and OS compared to those with <50% reduction. The study highlights the importance of precise PET/CT parameter evaluation for better prognostic stratification in PDAC patients. The authors disclosed potential conflicts of interest related to grants and personal fees from various pharmaceutical companies.
