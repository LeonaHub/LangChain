The study aimed to develop a new pulp capping material by incorporating bismuth oxide and calcium hydroxide into Portland cement. The physical properties of this new material were evaluated and compared with MTA. The initial and final setting times, compressive strength, diametral tensile strength, and push out bond strength were measured for each material. MTA showed the lowest setting times, while Portland cement with bismuth oxide had the highest compressive strength and push out bond strength. The addition of calcium hydroxide to Portland cement affected its strength properties, with 10 wt% showing acceptable physical and adhesive properties. The pH values of the materials were also measured, with MTA having higher pH values compared to the new material. Overall, the study suggests that the new pulp capping material with 10 wt% calcium hydroxide could be a viable alternative to MTA.
