The text discusses a study that investigated the susceptibility of various animal species to SARS-CoV-2 infection using in vitro and ex vivo primary cell culture models. The research focused on analyzing the mRNA expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL in the respiratory tracts of different mammalian species to understand tissue- and species-specific differences in cellular factors required for SARS-CoV-2 entry. The study found that dogs were permissive to viral infection, with efficient replication observed in nasal mucosa explants and lung slices. In contrast, ferrets did not support viral replication in the primary cell culture models used. The research also highlighted the importance of alternative receptors and cellular proteases in viral entry and the need for further studies to identify potential intermediate hosts and reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, limitations in the evaluation of cytopathic effects in the primary cell cultures were discussed, emphasizing the importance of considering environmental factors and immune responses in infection studies. Overall, the study underscores the significance of exploring new techniques to identify SARS-CoV-2 host species while minimizing the need for in vivo animal experiments.
