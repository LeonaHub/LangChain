The text discusses the magneto-strain effect in the 2D magnetic material CrGeTe3, focusing on its electronic and magnetic properties. The magneto-strain effect is attributed to the interplay between in-plane lattice contraction and out-of-plane spin-orbit coupling. The study reveals a shift in electronic bands away from the Fermi level, band broadening, and twinned bands in the ferromagnetic phase. The in-plane lattice contraction increases electron-electron repulsion between Cr atoms, leading to a shift in the Cr 3d band. Out-of-plane lattice contraction enhances hybridization between Cr and Ge atoms, resulting in band broadening. The spin polarization of Te 5p states is influenced by the interlayer interactions, contributing to the 2D ferromagnetism in CrGeTe3. The findings suggest potential applications in spintronics and strain engineering.
