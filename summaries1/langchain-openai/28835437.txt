The study introduced a novel CLEC-2 Y7A knockin mouse model that maintained surface expression of a signaling-dead CLEC-2 receptor. This model revealed a signaling-independent function of CLEC-2 in thrombus stability, distinct from its hemITAM signaling cascade. The Y7A mutation abolished platelet responses to CLEC-2 agonists without affecting receptor expression or major signaling proteins. The model showed normal platelet production initially, but platelet counts decreased over time due to blood-lymphatic mixing defects. Blocking the CLEC-2 ectodomain destabilized platelet aggregate formation under flow, indicating its role in thrombus stability. In vivo experiments demonstrated that CLEC-2 contributes to hemostasis and thrombus stability independently of hemITAM signaling. Further research is needed to identify the blood-borne ligand/counterreceptor of CLEC-2 for its signaling-independent adhesive role in thrombosis and hemostasis.
