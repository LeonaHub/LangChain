The text describes the discovery and optimization of a potent and selective inhibitor of the deubiquitinating enzyme USP21, named BAY-805 (compound 21). The study involved screening millions of compounds, hit-to-lead optimization, and cellular profiling to assess the compound's efficacy and selectivity. Compound 21 demonstrated high potency in biochemical and cellular assays, particularly in inhibiting USP21 activity and activating the NF-ÎºB pathway. The compound showed strong target engagement, selectivity against DUB family members and off-targets, and favorable physicochemical properties. Additionally, a less potent enantiomer, BAY-728 (compound 22), was identified as a negative control. The study concludes that BAY-805 is a highly potent USP21 chemical probe with well-characterized on- and off-target profiles, making it a valuable tool for further research on USP21 in various physiological and pathological conditions.
