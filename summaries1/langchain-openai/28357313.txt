The text describes the synthesis and biological effects of ergosterone-triazol hybrid molecules on Leishmania mexicana promastigotes. The compounds were synthesized through a series of chemical reactions involving ergosterol oxidation and coupling with Girard reagents. These molecules exhibited cytotoxic effects on the parasites, with Erg-GTr and Erg-GTr2 showing the highest potency and selectivity. The compounds induced phosphatidylserine exposure, DNA damage, cell cycle alterations, and ultrastructural changes in the parasites. They also triggered mitochondrial hyperpolarization, ROS production, and intracellular Ca2+ release. The mechanisms of action involved regulated cell death processes rather than accidental cell death. The compounds represent promising candidates for the development of new chemotherapeutic agents for leishmaniasis treatment. Various assays, including Annexin V binding, mitochondrial membrane potential analysis, DNA content analysis, transmission electron microscopy, reactive oxygen species determination, cytoplasmic Ca2+ level measurements, and acidocalcisome alkalinization, were performed to study the effects of these molecules on the parasites.
