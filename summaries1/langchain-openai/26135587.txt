The text discusses a review of non-pharmacological interventions for primary Sj√∂gren's syndrome (pSS) in adults. Five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the review, focusing on interventions such as punctal plugs, acupuncture, psychodynamic therapy, and oral lubrication devices. The studies had various outcomes related to dryness, but overall, the quality of the included studies was poor with high risk of bias and small sample sizes. The results were inconclusive, with punctal plugs showing some effectiveness, while other interventions did not show significant benefits. The studies lacked appropriate outcome measures relevant to patients' daily activities and quality of life. Further research is recommended to explore interventions like cognitive behavioral therapy and exercise training for managing symptoms in pSS. Overall, there is currently no strong evidence supporting non-pharmacological interventions to improve the quality of life for individuals with pSS.
