The study focused on assessing serum total LDH levels in preeclampsia and investigating the differential maternal serum and cord blood LDH isoenzyme profile in preeclampsia-eclampsia. The research involved 60 pregnant women, with 30 having preeclampsia and 30 as controls. Results showed a significant increase in serum LDH levels in preeclampsia, with a correlation to disease severity. The isoenzyme profile indicated a shift towards anaerobic forms in preeclampsia, suggesting a potential marker for hypoxia. The study suggests that LDH, along with isoenzyme distribution, could serve as a robust predictor for hypertensive disorders in pregnancy. Further validation in larger prospective studies is recommended. Limitations include the study's cross-sectional design and small sample size.
