The text discusses the role of the gut-enriched Kr√ºppel-like factor (GKLF) in transcriptional regulation and cell growth suppression. GKLF is a transcription factor with zinc fingers that is involved in regulating proliferation and differentiation in epithelial tissues. The study explores the mechanisms by which GKLF activates transcription, showing that acidic amino acid residues in its N-terminus are crucial for transactivation. It also demonstrates that GKLF interacts with the co-activator proteins p300/CBP, which are involved in transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, GKLF's growth-suppressing effect is linked to its transactivation ability and interaction with p300/CBP, with mutations in the acidic residues affecting these functions. Overall, the study highlights the complex interplay between transcriptional activation, protein-protein interaction, and growth suppression mediated by GKLF.
