The study investigated the role of the lncRNA HOXA11-AS in keloid formation, focusing on its interaction with miR-124-3p and TGFβR1. The research found that HOXA11-AS promoted keloid-related phenotypes by inhibiting apoptosis and enhancing angiogenesis in skin fibroblasts. This effect was mediated through the sponging of miR-124-3p, leading to the upregulation of TGFβR1 and activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. The study suggests that targeting HOXA11-AS or restoring miR-124-3p levels could be a potential therapeutic strategy for keloid disease. Further research is recommended to explore the effects of modulating miR-124-3p in in vivo keloid models and pre-clinical trials.
