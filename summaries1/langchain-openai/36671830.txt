The study focused on the phylogenetic analysis of Astragalus species within the subgenus Hypoglottis, particularly sections Stereothrix and Hypoglottidei. The research aimed to resolve taxonomic issues and determine the systematic positions of these species using molecular markers. The analysis included DNA sequencing, phylogenetic inferences, divergence time estimation, and incongruent length difference tests. The results revealed non-monophyly of sections Stereothrix and Hypoglottidei, indicating that the current classification may not accurately reflect the evolutionary history of these taxa. The study also highlighted the rapid speciation and young age of many Astragalus species in western Asia, suggesting that diverse climatic conditions may contribute to their diversification. The findings suggest the need for a revised classification system based on genome-wide DNA sequences to better understand the evolutionary trajectory and relationships within the genus Astragalus.
