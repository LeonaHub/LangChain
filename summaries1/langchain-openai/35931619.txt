The text discusses the development and validation of a European Portuguese version of the RESVECH 2.0 measurement instrument for monitoring the healing process of chronic wounds. The study involved cultural and linguistic adaptation, reliability testing, and validity testing. The sample included 281 patients with chronic wounds, and the Portuguese version of RESVECH 2.0 showed good internal consistency and agreement between raters. The construct validity was supported by factor analysis, and the scale's scores were related to wound-specific and quality of life measures. The study concluded that the Portuguese version of RESVECH 2.0 is a reliable and valid tool for assessing chronic wounds in research and clinical practice, with potential to improve outcomes and reduce the prevalence of chronic wounds. Further research is needed to assess its psychometric properties in different settings.
