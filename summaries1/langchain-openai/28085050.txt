The text discusses the association between the MTHFR gene polymorphisms, specifically C677T, and the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It highlights the impact of environmental factors, particularly air pollution, on this association through gene-environment interactions. The study conducted meta-analyses and meta-predictive analyses to examine these relationships across various geographic regions. The findings suggest that the MTHFR C677T polymorphism is linked to an increased risk of AD, with variations observed in different populations. The use of advanced analytical techniques, such as partition trees and GIS maps, helped visualize and understand the complex interactions between gene mutations, air pollution, and AD risks. The study concludes that epigenetic factors, including environmental toxins, may play a role in the development of AD, emphasizing the importance of further research and proactive strategies to address these risks, especially in areas with high air pollution levels.
