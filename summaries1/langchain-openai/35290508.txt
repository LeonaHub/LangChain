The text discusses the importance of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) in diagnosing prostate cancer (PCa) and staging the disease, particularly in identifying extra prostatic extension (EPE). The study evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of individual PI-RADS v2.1 mEPE features and develops a comprehensive mEPE-score based on these features. The mEPE-score combines qualitative and quantitative parameters to predict pEPE, showing good diagnostic performance with high sensitivity and specificity. The score is compared with existing scoring systems and validated internally and externally. The study highlights the importance of using a standardized score for consistent and reliable assessment of pEPE in PCa patients undergoing mpMRI, providing valuable information for clinical decision-making.
