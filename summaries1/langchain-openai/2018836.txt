The text discusses a case study of a patient with congenitally abnormal fibrinogen Ise, characterized by normal reptilase time but prolonged thrombin time due to delayed release of fibrinopeptide B. The patient had a single amino acid substitution of cysteine for glycine at Bβ 15, the NH2-terminus of fibrin β-chains. This substitution resulted in defective fibrin monomer polymerization and delayed exposure of the NH2-terminus of the β-chain, leading to prolonged thrombin time. The study also highlighted the role of Bβ-chains in fibrin clot formation and the effects of high concentrations of thrombin on fibrinogen structure and function. The findings suggest that a high concentration of thrombin can cleave not only the Aα Arg19-Val20 bond but also the COOH-terminal region of α-chains, leading to further degradation of α-chains in abnormal fibrinogens.
