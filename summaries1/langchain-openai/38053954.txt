The study investigated the effects of Quiet Eye (QE) training on attention in children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The research involved 72 children with ADHD who were divided into a QE training group and a control group. The QE training group underwent visuomotor training focusing on eye fixations during targeting tasks. Pre- and post-testing included neuropsychological tests and measurement of eye movement patterns during a visuomotor task. The results showed that QE training led to improvements in focused attention, concentration performance, and catch performance in the QE training group compared to the control group. The training also resulted in prolonged total time of eye fixations and enhanced sustained attention during the task. The study suggests that QE training may be an effective intervention for improving attention in children with ADHD.
