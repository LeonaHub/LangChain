The text discusses the characterization of Vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1) and its paralog, VKORC1L1, focusing on their membrane topology, enzymatic activity, and structure-function relationships. VKORC1L1 is a 4-TMD membrane protein with conserved loop cysteines in the ER lumen, essential for active site regeneration through an intra-molecular electron transfer pathway. Unlike VKORC1, VKORC1L1's loop cysteines are crucial for its function. The study suggests that VKORC1L1's overall structure, rather than specific sequences, determines its unique reaction mechanism. VKORC1L1's function in vitamin K-dependent carboxylation is comparable to VKORC1, indicating potential differences in their physiological roles. The findings highlight the evolutionary divergence between VKORC1L1 and VKORC1, suggesting VKORC1L1 may have evolved earlier and lost its role as a KO reductase in higher species.
