The study aimed to compare the effectiveness of chewing gum and pre-emptive tenoxicam for pain relief following initial archwire placement in orthodontic patients. A total of 40 female participants were divided into two groups, with one group using chewing gum and the other group taking tenoxicam. Pain levels were assessed using a visual analog scale at various time intervals after archwire placement. The results showed that both chewing gum and tenoxicam effectively reduced pain, with pain peaking at 24 hours and gradually decreasing by the seventh day. Chewing gum was found to be comparable to tenoxicam in pain control, especially during chewing activities. The study suggests that chewing gum can be a non-pharmacological alternative to analgesics for orthodontic pain management, offering a safe and cost-effective option without adverse reactions. Further research with larger sample sizes is recommended to establish standardized protocols for pain management in orthodontic treatment.
