The study conducted at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Ghana aimed to assess the awareness and knowledge of glaucoma among patients aged 40 years and above. The study found that 74% of participants were aware of glaucoma, with higher education levels being associated with increased awareness. However, despite high awareness, knowledge about glaucoma symptoms and presentation was low, with misconceptions prevalent. The study highlighted the need for improved educational strategies to enhance understanding of glaucoma, especially among lower socioeconomic populations, to promote early detection and treatment, ultimately reducing visual impairment and preserving quality of life. The study also noted limitations such as the small sample size and the hospital-based nature of the study, suggesting the need for community-based studies to further evaluate awareness and knowledge of glaucoma.
