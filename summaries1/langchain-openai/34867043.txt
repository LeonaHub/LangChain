The text discusses the potential chemopreventive effects of metformin (MET) against breast cancer initiation induced by environmental carcinogens in a rat model. The study explores the role of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and its downstream targets, such as CYP1A1, in breast carcinogenesis. Treatment with carcinogens like DMBA and TCDD activated AhR and promoted cancer initiation by inducing DNA damage, inhibiting apoptosis, and promoting cell proliferation. However, MET pretreatment reversed these effects by inducing apoptosis, inhibiting cell proliferation, and reducing oxidative DNA damage. MET also inhibited the formation of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in vitro. The study suggests that MET's chemopreventive effects are mediated through the inhibition of the AhR/CYP1A1 pathway and the suppression of CSC formation. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings at the enzymatic activity level.
