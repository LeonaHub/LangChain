The study focused on tracking influenza cases in outpatient clinics across the Los Angeles area using Sofia influenza A+B FIA and Virena software. The research aimed to predict influenza activity in the emergency department (ED) by analyzing outpatient data. Results showed that the number of positive influenza tests in outpatient clinics preceded an influx of cases in the ED, providing an early warning sign. The study demonstrated the potential of using outpatient influenza data to predict ED influenza activity, enabling timely infection prevention measures and resource allocation. The use of Sofia influenza A+B FIA and Virena software proved effective in tracking influenza activity in the community setting, offering valuable insights for healthcare decision-making processes. Future directions include expanding the study to include additional respiratory viruses and adjusting the algorithm yearly to enhance predictive capabilities.
