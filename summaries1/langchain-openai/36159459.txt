The study focused on the extraction of dietary fiber from sweet potato peels using different methods and its effects on in vitro simulated intestinal fermentation. Four extraction methods (hot water extraction, ultrasonic extraction, subcritical water extraction, and microwave extraction) were used to obtain soluble dietary fiber. The study investigated the impact of these dietary fibers on intestinal fermentation by analyzing parameters such as gas production, short-chain fatty acid production, pH, ammonia content, reducing sugar content, and degradation rate. The results showed that dietary fiber from sweet potato peels positively influenced intestinal microecology by promoting the growth of beneficial gut bacteria, reducing harmful bacteria, and improving the production of short-chain fatty acids. Among the extraction methods, ultrasonic extraction demonstrated the most significant improvement in overall intestinal microecological health. The study highlights the potential of sweet potato dietary fiber as a functional ingredient for promoting gut health.
