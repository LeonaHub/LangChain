The text discusses the interaction between viruses and sphingolipid metabolism, focusing on the roles of sphingosine kinase (SK) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) lyase in regulating virus replication. Specifically, it highlights the inhibitory effects of S1P lyase overexpression on influenza virus replication and the pro-viral function of SK1 in enhancing influenza virus infection. The text also delves into the molecular mechanisms by which SK and S1P lyase influence influenza virus replication, including their impact on cellular signaling pathways such as NF-ÎºB and ERK MAPK. Furthermore, it explores the modulation of SK activity by various viruses, such as human cytomegalovirus, bovine viral diarrhea virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and dengue virus type-2, showcasing the diverse interactions between viruses and sphingolipid metabolism. Overall, the text emphasizes the importance of understanding these interactions for developing novel strategies to combat viral infections.
