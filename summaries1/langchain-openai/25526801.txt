The text discusses the molecular modeling, docking simulation, mutagenesis, and characterization of RGD-hirudin and its mutant variants in interaction with thrombin. The study focused on identifying key residues involved in the binding and inhibition of thrombin by RGD-hirudin. Results showed that Tyr3 in the N-terminus and residues Ser50, Gln53, Asp55, Glu57, and Ile59 in the C-terminus of RGD-hirudin play crucial roles in the interaction with thrombin. Mutations in these residues led to decreased anti-thrombin activity and weaker binding affinity with thrombin. Surface plasmon resonance analysis confirmed the importance of these residues in the binding process. The study provides insights into the structural basis of RGD-hirudin's interaction with thrombin, which could be valuable for the development of new antithrombin peptides for combating thrombotic diseases.
