The study investigated the contents of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) such as Nε-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML) and Nε-(carboxyethyl)lysine (CEL), as well as acrylamide in 15 commercially sold plant-based meat analogs (PBMA). The research also examined the factors influencing the formation of these compounds, including protein, amino acids, sugars, and fatty acids in PBMA. Results showed varying levels of CML, CEL, and acrylamide in the PBMA samples, with protein content ranging from 24.03% to 53.18%. Amino acid profiles indicated that Met + Cys were the limiting amino acids in most PBMA. Fatty acid profiles were influenced by added plant oils, with n-6 fatty acids predominating. Correlation analyses revealed relationships between certain amino acids, fatty acids, and sugars with CML, CEL, and acrylamide content. Future studies will focus on understanding the formation mechanisms and strategies to reduce CML, CEL, and acrylamide in PBMA.
