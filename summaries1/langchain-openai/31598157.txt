The study investigated the association between two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MAGE-A11 gene and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) susceptibility and prognosis. The SNPs, rs6641352 and rs6540341, were found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of RCC. Specifically, the rs6641352 SNP was linked to a higher risk of RCC development and a poorer prognosis, while rs6540341 showed a strong association with RCC risk but not with prognosis. The study also identified specific demographic and clinical factors that may interact with these SNPs to influence RCC susceptibility. The findings suggest that these MAGE-A11 SNPs may play a role in RCC development, although further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms.
