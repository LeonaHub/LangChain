The text discusses a study conducted in Benin to analyze the genetic and morphometric characteristics of Aedes aegypti populations across different landscape types. The study aimed to investigate the influence of geography and landscape type on the populations of this important vector species. Mosquitoes were collected from four sites in Benin, representing urban, semi-urban, and sylvatic areas. Genetic analysis of COI gene sequences revealed high genetic diversity with seven distinct haplotypes identified. The most prevalent haplotype was found across all sites, but differences were observed in haplotype distribution among the locations. The study also assessed wing size and shape using geometric morphometric analysis, showing significant differences in wing size among landscape types, with the semi-urban site displaying the highest centroid size. However, there was no statistically significant difference in wing shape among the landscape types. The study suggests that habitat quality and environmental factors may influence wing size variation in Ae. aegypti populations. The findings highlight the high genetic and morphological diversity of Ae. aegypti at a microgeographical scale in Benin, providing insights into the biology and population structure of this important vector species.
