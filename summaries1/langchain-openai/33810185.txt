The study focused on the accumulation patterns of bioactive compounds in barley grains under high-temperature stress conditions. Four barley genotypes were analyzed for grain weight, Î²-glucans, arabinoxylans, phenolic compounds, and antioxidant capacity during grain filling. Results showed that genotypic effects were more significant than environmental factors for most bioactive compounds. Heat stress did not significantly affect dietary fiber content but increased phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity, especially in certain genotypes. Anthocyanins peaked before the end of grain filling, and free and bound phenols decreased as grains developed. The antioxidant capacity decreased over time, with a steeper decline in control plots compared to stress-induced ones. The findings suggest that food barley cultivation in high-temperature stress-prone areas can lead to increased bioactive compounds and antioxidant capacity, supporting the potential for barley-based products in such conditions. Early harvesting of non-mature grains could maximize antioxidant capacity for market purposes.
