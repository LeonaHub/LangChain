The text discusses the association between Aortic Stenosis (AS) and acquired Von Willebrand disease (AVWD), a condition where high shear stress from the stenotic valve leads to Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) deficiency. This deficiency can result in bleeding complications, particularly gastrointestinal bleeding. Surgical replacement of the valve has been shown to reverse this condition. While this relationship is not widely known among clinicians, further research is needed to establish a strong causality and develop strategies to address associated complications beyond anemia.
