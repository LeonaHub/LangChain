The study focuses on the 5-year outcomes of endoscopic nasopharyngectomy for recurrent, localized nasopharyngeal carcinoma (rNPC) in North America. Thirteen patients were followed up, with an 84.6% 5-year overall survival rate. The study highlights the efficacy of endoscopic surgery in treating rT1 and rT2 staged rNPC, with minimal complications. Patients with early cStages had better disease-free and overall survival rates. Recurrent cases were managed with repeat surgeries, but aggressive, treatment-resistant tumors led to disease progression and mortality. Close surveillance and prompt management were crucial for achieving satisfactory 5-year local control and overall survival rates. The study contributes valuable insights into the long-term outcomes of endoscopic nasopharyngectomy for rNPC.
