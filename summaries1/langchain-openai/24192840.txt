The text discusses tandem repeats (TRs) in DNA sequences, which are motifs with adjacent repeating units found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. TRs are categorized into microsatellites (1-6 bp) and minisatellites (10-60 bp). The study analyzed TRs in 31 plant and green algal genomes, finding no correlation between TR density and genome size. TRs were found to be preferentially located in specific regions, with 5'-UTRs having the highest density in plants. The distribution of TR motifs was influenced by GC content, with GC-rich motifs preferred in regions with high GC content. TR motifs were found to be more abundant in introns and CDS regions in green algae, suggesting potential roles in RNA processing and protein synthesis. The study also highlighted limitations in data analysis and the need for further research to understand the evolutionary trends and biological functions of TRs in plants and green algae.
