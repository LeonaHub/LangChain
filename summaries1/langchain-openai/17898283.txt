The text discusses a study on the early stages of glaucomatous damage in monkey eyes, focusing on the permanent deformation and thickening of the lamina cribrosa, scleral flange, and peripapillary sclera. The study utilized 3D reconstructions and delineation techniques to quantify the position and thickness of these connective tissues in normal and glaucomatous eyes. The findings suggest that in experimental glaucoma, there is a significant posterior deformation and thickening of the lamina cribrosa, as well as posterior deformation of the scleral flange and peripapillary sclera. The study highlights the importance of these structural changes in understanding glaucomatous damage and suggests that visualization of these landmarks could be crucial in clinical glaucoma imaging for assessing individual susceptibility to the disease and determining target IOP levels. The study also discusses the implications of these findings for biomechanical factors contributing to glaucomatous damage and the potential for early detection of the disease through imaging of these deep structures.
