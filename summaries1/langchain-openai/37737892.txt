The text discusses the neurological manifestations of Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection, focusing on cases of extrahepatic manifestations such as neuralgic amyotrophy/plexus neuritis and encephalitis. The study evaluated patients with various neurological diseases, retrospectively analyzing serum samples for HEV serology. Results showed that some patients with neuralgic amyotrophy/plexus neuritis had elevated anti-HEV-IgM and anti-HEV-IgG levels, suggesting a possible link between HEV infection and these conditions. The study highlights the importance of considering HEV in cases of unknown neurological symptoms and the need for further research to understand the relationship between HEV infection and neurological manifestations.
