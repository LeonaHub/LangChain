The text discusses a study on the impact of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) on total knee arthroplasty (TKA) outcomes. The study analyzed data from patients who underwent primary TKA between 2011 and 2021, categorizing CVI into simple, complex, and unclassified severities. The results showed that patients with complex CVI had a higher risk of post-TKA complications compared to those with simple CVI. However, overall, a general CVI diagnosis did not significantly affect postoperative complications. The study highlighted the importance of stratifying CVI severity to predict post-TKA outcomes accurately. The findings also indicated a higher prevalence of CVI in recent years but decreased composite complications, suggesting improvements in surgical care over time. The study emphasized the need for further research on CVI and its effects on TKA outcomes.
