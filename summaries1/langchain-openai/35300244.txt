The text discusses a case of a 58-year-old female with aortic intramural haematoma (AIH) type B, which was initially diagnosed based on CT scans showing a thrombosed aortic dissection. The patient underwent thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) due to the presence of significant entry and exit tears. However, a month later, a proximal aortic dissection was observed, leading to open surgery. The text highlights the challenges in diagnosing and managing AIH, emphasizing the importance of careful risk assessment before opting for TEVAR. It also discusses the complications associated with TEVAR, such as aortic dissection, migration, and endoleak. The text concludes by emphasizing the need for close monitoring and a tailored approach to treatment in cases of AIH.
