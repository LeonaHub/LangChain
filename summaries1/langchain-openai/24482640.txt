The study investigated neutrophil apoptosis in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hemodialysis (HD) patients, as well as the impact of granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) on neutrophil function. Results showed accelerated neutrophil apoptosis in CKD and HD patients, with higher apoptosis rates in CKD patients. Neutrophil activation was also increased in these patients. Addition of GM-CSF delayed neutrophil apoptosis and improved cell viability in both groups. The study suggests that GM-CSF may be a potential therapeutic option to reduce infections in CKD and HD patients. Further research is needed to explore the clinical implications of GM-CSF in enhancing neutrophil function and resistance to infections.
