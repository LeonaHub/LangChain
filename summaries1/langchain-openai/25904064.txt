The text discusses the use of Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI IMS) for visualizing biomolecules in tissue. It highlights the challenges in identifying proteins in tissue using MALDI IMS and the limitations of traditional identification strategies. The text introduces the concept of indirect identification and the advantages of using high-resolution and high-accuracy mass spectrometry instruments like MALDI FTICR MS for protein identification in IMS experiments. It presents a case study demonstrating the capabilities of MALDI FTICR MS in elucidating multiple proteoforms of S100A8 in kidney tissue of mice infected with Staphylococcus aureus. The study showcases the ability of MALDI FTICR IMS to provide detailed spatial information on protein modifications and their localization in infectious foci, enhancing our understanding of host-pathogen interactions. The text concludes by emphasizing the importance of developing methods for detecting and identifying proteins with larger molecular weights to further advance molecular imaging technologies.
