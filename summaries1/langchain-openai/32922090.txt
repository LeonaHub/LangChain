The study focused on evaluating cervical softness in twin pregnancies compared to singleton pregnancies using shear wave elastography (SWE). The research found that mid-trimester cervical SWS measurements at the lower point showed differences in cervical softness between twins and singletons. This suggests that SWE could be a useful tool for monitoring changes in cervical softness in twin pregnancies. However, the study acknowledged limitations such as sample size and the need for further research to fully assess the benefits of SWE in preterm surveillance for twin pregnancies.
