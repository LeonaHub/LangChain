The study focused on investigating the potential role of LTBP2 gene mutations in primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) patients. A total of 55 patients were screened for LTBP2 gene variations, with 24 variations identified. Among these, two novel coding variations, p. Gln1417Arg and p. Gly1660Trp, were considered potential contributors to PACG based on evolutionary conservation, absence in control individuals, and predicted damaging effects on protein function. The study suggests that these mutations, along with other factors, may play a role in the development of PACG. Further research is recommended to explore the impact of LTBP2 mutations in a larger cohort of PACG patients and investigate the role of LTBP2 in the extracellular matrix in relation to PACG.
