The study examined kcal labelling practices, customer purchasing behavior, and levels of noticing and using kcal labelling in the out-of-home food sector (OHFS) in England prior to the implementation of mandatory kcal labelling regulations. Findings showed that only a minority of sampled businesses provided any form of kcal labelling, and when present, labelling did not fully adhere to best practice recommendations. Customers tended to purchase and consume meals high in kcals, with underestimation of energy content. Noticing and use of kcal labelling were low, with only a small percentage reporting it influenced their purchasing decisions. The study highlighted socio-demographic variations in purchasing behavior and kcal labelling use. Recommendations included improving labelling clarity and prominence to increase awareness and use. Limitations included missing data from outlets without kcal information and reliance on self-reporting. Future research should assess the impact of mandatory kcal labelling on consumer behavior in the OHFS.
