The study focused on the remake rates of single-unit crowns in dental practices, with a 3.8% remake rate observed. Factors such as dentist experience, practice busyness, and patient characteristics were associated with remake rates and clinical evaluation of crown fit. Dentists with more experience reported lower remake rates, while patients receiving crowns tended to be educated with a mean age of 55 years old. The study highlighted the subjective nature of clinical acceptability evaluations and potential biases in the assessment process. Limitations included the subjective nature of the primary outcome measure and the non-random recruitment of network practitioners.
