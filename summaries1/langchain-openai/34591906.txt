The text discusses a study conducted in Seoul, South Korea, using data from the 2017 Seoul Survey to examine the association between companion animal ownership and overall life satisfaction. The study found that pet ownership was positively correlated with higher levels of overall life satisfaction. Specifically, owners of both dogs and cats had the highest average satisfaction levels, followed by single pet owners of either a cat or a dog. The study also analyzed the impact of the number of pets owned on life satisfaction, with single pet ownership associated with higher satisfaction levels compared to owning two or more pets. Additionally, the study highlighted the importance of considering both pet types and the number of pets owned in future research to deepen the understanding of the relationship between pet ownership and human well-being. The text also discusses the limitations of the study, such as the cross-sectional design, small sample sizes for certain pet ownership categories, and the lack of information on the duration and history of pet ownership. Despite these limitations, the study provides valuable insights into the companion animal effect on human health and well-being, advocating for further research in this area.
