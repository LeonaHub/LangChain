Workplace bullying is a prevalent issue that can have significant negative impacts on individuals and organizations, leading to physical and mental health issues, increased sick leave, turnover, and reduced productivity. Studies have shown a higher risk of suicidal behavior among individuals exposed to bullying, with the integrated motivational-volitional model of suicidal behavior suggesting that workplace bullying can trigger suicidal ideation and behavior. A systematic review and meta-analysis found a significant association between workplace bullying and suicidal ideation, with individuals experiencing bullying having higher odds of suicidal thoughts. However, the relationship between bullying and suicidal behavior became nonsignificant after adjusting for confounding factors. The study identified moderators and mediators impacting this relationship and suggested the need for more prospective studies to better understand and control for confounding factors. The findings emphasize the importance of addressing workplace bullying to prevent negative outcomes such as suicidal ideation and behavior.
