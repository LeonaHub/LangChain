Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has therapeutic benefits for various conditions such as epilepsy, depression, chronic pain, and tinnitus. Transcutaneous VNS (tVNS) is a less invasive alternative to traditional VNS, with studies showing its effectiveness in treating chronic tinnitus. A study investigated the effects of tVNS paired with notched music therapy on patients with unilateral tinnitus, showing improvements in tinnitus severity, loudness, and awareness. While not all cases achieved complete remission, the treatment aimed to correct maladapted neuronal plasticity in the central auditory system. Safety measures were taken during the treatment, and the use of notched music therapy was highlighted for its role in transferring electrical stimulation to the auditory cortex. Further research is needed to determine optimal stimulation parameters and long-term effectiveness.
