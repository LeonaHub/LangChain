The text discusses the importance of intrinsic motivation in cognitive remediation interventions for schizophrenia, emphasizing the need to focus on increasing patients' enjoyment and value of training tasks. It describes a study that investigated a motivational approach in enhancing learning for adults with schizophrenia, showing that motivation-enhancing techniques led to greater learning outcomes and improved perceived self-competency. The study also explored the impact of a motivational math game on arithmetic ability in individuals with schizophrenia, finding that the group using the motivational game made greater gains in arithmetic. The text suggests that while motivation-enhancing techniques were effective for some individuals, different strategies may be needed based on individual preferences. The study contributes to understanding motivation and cognition in schizophrenia and highlights the need for further research in this area, considering factors such as computer familiarity and skill levels of participants.
