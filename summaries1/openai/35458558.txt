The text discusses the origin and transmission of beta-coronaviruses, particularly focusing on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. It explores potential animal reservoirs and intermediate hosts for the virus, emphasizing the importance of understanding susceptibility in different animal species to prevent zoonotic transmission. The study investigates the mRNA expression of key factors for SARS-CoV-2 entry in various animal species' respiratory tracts using in vitro and ex vivo models. Findings show differences in susceptibility among species, with dogs, hamsters, and humans supporting viral replication. The research highlights the role of ACE2 as the main receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and the significance of other proteases in viral entry. The study also suggests potential alternative receptors for viral entry. It compares the susceptibility of different species, such as dogs, hamsters, and ferrets, to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The text mentions limitations in detecting viral effects in some models and stresses the need for further research to understand animal involvement in virus transmission and the emergence of new variants.
