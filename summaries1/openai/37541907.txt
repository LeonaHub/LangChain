Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory condition that affects multiple organ systems, leading to pain, functional limitations, and psychological effects. Patients with PsA often have comorbid conditions such as obesity, sedentary lifestyles, and mental health issues, increasing their risk of developing metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. Lifestyle modifications, nonpharmacologic interventions, and psychological support are crucial in managing PsA. A systematic review was conducted to consolidate existing evidence on nonpharmacologic interventions for PsA to improve health-related quality of life. The review included various study types, such as qualitative and quantitative studies, to address the knowledge gap in this area. The primary objective was to determine the effectiveness of lifestyle modifications and nonpharmacologic interventions in improving outcomes for patients with PsA. The review outlined the criteria and methodology used to identify studies on nonpharmacologic interventions, psychological interventions, and lifestyle modifications for adults with PsA. The search strategy included various lifestyle factors such as smoking, diet, exercise, mental health, and complementary therapies. The review team screened and selected relevant studies based on predefined inclusion criteria, conducted data extraction and quality assessment, and evaluated the risk of bias. Meta-analysis was limited due to study heterogeneity, and a meta-synthesis approach was used for qualitative data. Studies on physical activity, resistance training, high-intensity interval training, diet, and smoking cessation in PsA patients were discussed, highlighting positive impacts on health measures and disease outcomes. The text emphasizes the need for further high-quality research to determine the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions in managing PsA and the potential influence of factors like diet, exercise, education, and socioeconomic status on disease outcomes. Overall, while there is limited evidence suggesting that lifestyle modifications may improve outcomes in PsA, more research is needed in this area to inform future care.
