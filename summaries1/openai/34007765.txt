Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a significant concern among older adults globally, with a high prevalence. Fragility fractures, particularly affecting the elderly, are a major public health issue. Studies suggest that individuals with T2DM are more susceptible to fragility fractures, especially hip fractures. However, there is some controversy regarding non-vertebral fractures in T2DM patients. Factors contributing to increased fracture risk in T2DM include hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines, and hormonal imbalances. Patients with T2DM may have normal to high bone mineral density but are still at an increased risk of fractures. Various factors like longstanding diabetes, complications, poor glycemic control, and medications can affect bone quality and increase fracture risk. Current fracture risk assessment tools may underestimate the risk in diabetic patients, and additional diagnostic tools are recommended for more accurate assessments. Pharmacological treatments for T2DM can impact bone strength and fracture risk differently, with some medications having a positive impact on bone mineral density and reducing fracture risk, while others may have a negative impact. Specific fracture risk factors in T2DM patients, such as duration of diabetes and HbA1c levels, should be considered in treatment decisions. Further research is needed to understand the effectiveness of anti-osteoporotic treatments in T2DM patients and to monitor bone fragility in elderly T2DM patients.
