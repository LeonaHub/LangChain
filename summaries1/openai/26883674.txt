Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder affecting 4% of adults, characterized by intermittent hypoxia, hypoxaemia, sleep fragmentation, and excessive daytime sleepiness. OSA has been linked to various comorbidities, particularly cardiovascular disease (CVD), due to malfunctions in neural, hormonal, thrombotic, and metabolic pathways. A study involving 3582 patients from the Shanghai Sleep Health Study cohort examined the association between OSA severity and dyslipidemia, revealing a nonlinear multistage relationship. The study found that traditional linear models were inadequate for analyzing this correlation, leading to a more detailed seven-group stratification based on apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) values. Results showed non-linear and non-monotonic relationships between dyslipidemia and OSA severity, with different lipid risk factors being relevant at different stages of OSA. The study suggests tailored interventions for dyslipidemia management based on OSA severity and calls for further research, including large-scale randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up.
