The text discusses the Complexity Account of Treatment Efficacy in treating lexical semantic deficits in individuals with aphasia, focusing on semantic complexity within semantic categories. It proposes a complexity hierarchy based on item typicality and presents experimental studies on treatment effectiveness, exploring factors influencing success and applications in developing treatments. Various models of semantic representation are discussed, emphasizing the distinction between living and nonliving categories. The text explains how typicality influences access to category items and discusses prototype/family resemblance models. It highlights the complexity hierarchy between typical and atypical examples, supported by reaction time differences in tasks. The impact of semantic complexity on naming treatment for aphasia individuals is explored, emphasizing the importance of strengthening semantic attributes for generalization. Studies on treatment outcomes for typical and atypical items within semantic categories are referenced, showing generalization effects. Theoretical models of word retrieval and category structure theories are discussed in relation to treatment outcomes. The text also addresses factors influencing treatment success, such as age, time post-stroke onset, and aphasia subtype, and the importance of selecting appropriate stimuli and semantic features. It emphasizes the need for further research on semantic complexity and its role in language recovery patterns in aphasia individuals.
