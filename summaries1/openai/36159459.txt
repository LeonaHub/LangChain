The text discusses the importance of gut microbiota in human health and how dietary factors, particularly dietary fiber from sweet potato peels, can influence the composition of gut microbiota and promote intestinal health. Researchers have explored various extraction methods to obtain dietary fiber from sweet potato peels and studied its effects on intestinal fermentation, gas production, short-chain fatty acid content, pH levels, and microbial diversity. The study involved in vitro fermentation models using different extraction techniques and analyzed the impact of dietary fiber on gut microbiota composition, short-chain fatty acid production, and gas generation. Results showed that dietary fiber from sweet potato peels influenced the abundance of beneficial bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium, while reducing harmful bacteria. The study also highlighted the relationship between dietary fiber, short-chain fatty acids, and gut flora abundance, suggesting that sweet potato dietary fiber can improve intestinal health by modulating gut microbiota.
