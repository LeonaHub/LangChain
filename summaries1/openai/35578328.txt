Peer-led interventions in schools have been effective in addressing health behavior problems among adolescents and young adults. Research on the implementation processes and practices of peer-led programs is still developing, with a focus on selecting influential peer leaders for optimal diffusion of information. A study on a peer-led suicide prevention program called Sources of Strength in rural high schools analyzed different methods for selecting peer leaders, such as Peer Opinion Leaders, Friendship Network Opinion Leaders, Key Players, and Hybrid Methods. The study found that network-informed selection methods, like the Key Players algorithm, were effective in reaching at-risk students and enhancing intervention diffusion. Concordance between theoretical selection methods and actual selection by adults was also explored, highlighting the importance of optimizing peer leader selection methods for improved intervention outcomes. The study suggests that interventions targeting at-risk students may benefit from indirect community role models and peer leaders closely connected to the target population within the friendship network. Further research is needed to evaluate the impact of different selection methods on intervention diffusion in school networks.
