Tandem repeats (TRs) are repetitive DNA sequences found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, categorized into microsatellites and minisatellites. They are mutable and can lead to genetic diseases in humans and detrimental phenotypes in plants. TRs play roles in gene expression and regulation, with variability in abundance among species. Research focuses on detecting and characterizing TRs in plant and algae genomes, analyzing their distribution and biological functions. Studies show variations in TR density among species, with localization preferences in different genomic regions. The influence of GC content on TR motifs is noted, with differences observed among species and regions. TR motifs show specific prevalence in certain plant species and regions, with distribution patterns indicating potential roles in transcription and translation regulation. The study emphasizes the need for further research to understand the evolutionary trends and biological functions of TRs in plant and green alga genomes.
