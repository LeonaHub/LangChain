Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy with a complex multistep carcinogenesis process involving factors like chronic hepatitis B and C viruses, smoking, and alcohol abuse. DNA repair genes, such as XRCC1, play a crucial role in maintaining genome integrity. A systematic review and meta-analysis of case-control studies were conducted to investigate the association between XRCC1 gene polymorphisms and HCC risk. The study included 11 articles focusing on three XRCC1 polymorphisms: Arg194Trp, Arg280His, and Arg399Gln. Results showed mixed associations between these polymorphisms and HCC risk in different populations. While the Arg194Trp and Arg399Gln polymorphisms were not significantly associated with HCC risk, there was some evidence suggesting a potential association between the XRCC1 Arg280His polymorphism and increased HCC risk. However, further research with larger populations and diverse ethnicities is needed to clarify the impact of XRCC1 gene polymorphisms on cancer risk.
