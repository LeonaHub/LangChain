Preeclampsia is a serious pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure and proteinuria, with risk factors including nulliparity, obesity, and maternal age. A study involving 60 pregnant women aimed to assess lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in preeclampsia, finding significant elevation in LDH levels in preeclampsia groups, with LDH isoenzyme profiles indicating potential markers for ischemia and tissue damage. Elevated LDH levels were more common in preeclamptic women, showing sensitivity and specificity in detecting preeclampsia severity. LDH levels reflect tissue damage and oxygen availability, with changes in LDH isoenzyme profiles suggesting hypoxia-induced endothelial pathology. The study suggests LDH as a potential marker for managing preeclampsia, emphasizing the importance of assessing LDH along with routine markers for early risk assessment. Limitations include a small sample size and cross-sectional design, calling for further validation in larger prospective studies.
