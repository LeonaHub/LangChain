Heavy drinking is a prevalent issue among college students, prompting a national call to action to reduce alcohol consumption on campuses. Various interventions, such as mandatory sanctions and educational programs, have been implemented to address this issue. Research has shown that skills-based and motivational interventions, including personalized feedback, have been effective in reducing alcohol use and negative consequences among mandated students. Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) and Student Assistance Programs have shown promise in supporting individuals with substance abuse and personal issues. A study evaluated the University Alcohol Program (UAP) for mandated students, showing reductions in weekday alcohol consumption and alcohol-related consequences, as well as stable coping skills and increased protective behaviors compared to standard care services. However, there were no significant differences in total weekly or weekend alcohol consumption. The study suggests the need for further research on coping skills and tailored interventions for mandated students to address heavy drinking effectively.
