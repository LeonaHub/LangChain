Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a serious global health issue characterized by proteinuria and hypertension in pregnant women around 32 weeks of gestation. Despite advancements in diagnosis and treatment, interventions for PE are not entirely effective. Research suggests that inadequate vascular remodeling of maternal spiral arteries, particularly due to trophoblast invasion issues, is a key factor in PE pathogenesis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified as potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers in PE, with miR-210 and its downstream target PTPN2 being investigated in this study. The study utilized cell culture techniques to demonstrate that miR-210 expression increases under hypoxic conditions, promoting cell viability, migration, and invasion. PTPN2 was identified as a downstream target of miR-210, with inhibition of miR-210 leading to increased PTPN2 expression. The study also explored the involvement of miR-210 in the PDGFR-Akt signaling pathway and its potential role in diseases like lung cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. The findings suggest that miR-210 and PTPN2 may play crucial roles in PE pathogenesis by affecting cell behaviors and signaling pathways, making them potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for PE. However, further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms involved, including in vivo validation and a more comprehensive understanding of the miR-210 pathway in PE.
