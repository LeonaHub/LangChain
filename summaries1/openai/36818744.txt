The text discusses the concept of Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) as a metric for evaluating the market competitiveness of different energy sources, particularly focusing on renewable energy like solar power and emerging technologies such as perovskite solar cells (PSCs). It highlights challenges in calculating LCOE for PSCs, including performance evaluation, stability, scalability, and supply chain constraints. The text emphasizes the importance of precise evaluations of LCOE to assess the potential impact of PSCs in the energy market transition. It also addresses factors affecting LCOE calculations, such as capital costs, operation and maintenance costs, energy production, discount rates, and financing costs. The text discusses the increasing number of works reporting LCOE calculations for perovskite PV systems and the challenges in predicting energy output and efficiency losses during scaling-up. It also mentions the importance of conversion efficiency, stability, and manufacturing costs in advancing perovskite solar cell technology. The text concludes by highlighting the potential for standard production lines and strategies to reduce LCOE by improving performance, stability, and manufacturing costs in perovskite PV technology.
