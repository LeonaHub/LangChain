Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) is a rare fibroblastic mesenchymal neoplasm that primarily affects spindle cell soft tissues, with typically benign behavior and rare metastasis. While commonly found in the pleura and thorax, SFT can occur throughout the body, including the central nervous system (CNS). Malignant intracranial SFT is rare and can be misinterpreted as meningioma, with metastasis to the chest wall being unprecedented. The text presents a case study of an 81-year-old man with intracranial malignant SFT metastasizing to the chest wall, leading to his passing despite palliative care. The discussion includes clinical characteristics, outcomes, imaging findings, and diagnostic markers for SFT, emphasizing the importance of identifying the NAB2-STAT6 fusion gene and the TERT gene promoter mutation. Surgical excision is the primary treatment for localized SFT, while radiotherapy and targeted therapies show promise for advanced cases. Long-term monitoring is crucial due to the risk of recurrence and metastasis. The prognosis of malignant SFT is poor, with factors like tumor characteristics and histopathological features influencing outcomes. Dedifferentiation is highlighted as a key factor in SFT prognosis, emphasizing the need for complete resection and thorough follow-up in patients with SFT.
