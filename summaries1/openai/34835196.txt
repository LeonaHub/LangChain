A new antibody sandwich ELISA method was developed to detect the major capsid protein (MCP) antigen concentration in inactivated Infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV) vaccines. The study involved generating mouse monoclonal antibodies against ISKNV, optimizing the ELISA assay, and characterizing the antibodies. The method was sensitive, specific, and accurate in detecting antigen concentrations in the vaccines. The study also highlighted the importance of quality evaluation of inactivated whole-virus vaccines and the utility of monoclonal antibodies in developing efficient vaccine detection methods. The double-antibody sandwich ELISA method was effective in detecting antigen quality and viral titers in inactivated vaccines, demonstrating reliability and accuracy.
