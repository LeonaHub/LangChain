The text discusses the extraction of polysaccharides from brown macroalgae, focusing on optimizing extraction conditions to maximize yields of bioactive compounds such as fucose and total glucans with antioxidant properties. Various extraction methods, including hydrothermal-assisted extraction and multiple extraction cycles, are explored to enhance efficiency. Statistical optimization tools like response surface methodology are used to determine the impact of extraction variables like temperature, time, and solvent volume on the extraction process. The study provides equations and regression models to predict optimal conditions for extracting bioactive compounds from macroalgae, specifically L. hyperborea, and explores the potential for similar optimized conditions in other brown macroalgae species. The text also highlights the variability in polysaccharide content and chemical structure among different macroalgae species, emphasizing the need for separate extraction approaches for different molecules in future biorefinery processes. Additionally, the study discusses the measurement of antioxidant activity in macroalgal extracts and the use of ultrasound and thermal technologies to increase polysaccharide recoveries. Further research is suggested to purify and characterize the extracted fractions for industrial applications.
