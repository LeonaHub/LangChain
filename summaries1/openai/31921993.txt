A film and curriculum were developed to address medical student mistreatment by promoting mutual empathy and understanding between learners and educators. The film was based on focus group narratives and covered various topics related to the learning environment. Separate curricula were created for students and faculty, aiming to enhance cultural humility and bridge generational gaps in medicine. The curriculum was effective in stimulating discussions and promoting behavior changes among participants. While well-received, further research is needed to assess long-term impacts. The curriculum was seen as a valuable tool for enhancing understanding and empathy in the clinical learning environment, emphasizing shared responsibility for creating a positive culture in healthcare settings.
