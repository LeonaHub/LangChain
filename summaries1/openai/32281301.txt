The text discusses the challenges in treating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and emphasizes the importance of using imaging techniques like CT and FDG PET/CT to evaluate treatment effectiveness. Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) is highlighted as a strategy to improve resectability and prognosis in PDAC patients. A study involving 22 PDAC patients who underwent NAT followed by surgery aimed to confirm the usefulness of FDG PET/CT parameters in evaluating treatment effects and analyzing prognostic factors. The study protocol involved assessing tumor resectability using CE-CT and FDG PET/CT before and after NAT. The text also discusses the limitations of using RECIST guidelines for evaluating PDAC treatment effects and the benefits of using FDG PET/CT parameters like metabolic tumor volume (MTV) for prognosis. The study found that PERCIST was more sensitive and accurate in predicting treatment response compared to RECIST, and MTV reduction rate was identified as a valuable prognostic factor for PDAC patients undergoing neoadjuvant treatment. The text highlights the significance of PET/CT imaging in evaluating treatment response and prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients, suggesting that precise evaluation of PET/CT parameters can lead to more effective treatments and better prognostic stratification for PDAC patients.
