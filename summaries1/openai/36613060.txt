The text discusses a study on the prevalence of eating disorders in Chinese children and the validation of the Children's Eating Attitude Test (ChEAT) as a screening tool. The study involved 906 children in Shanghai, China, and found that 10.71% showed positive eating disorder symptoms. The ChEAT questionnaire was found to have good construct validity and reliability, with four identified factors. The study also explored associations between ChEAT scores and BMI, gender differences in eating behaviors, and the influence of body dissatisfaction on eating disorder symptoms. The study concluded that the Chinese version of the ChEAT is reliable and valid for assessing eating behaviors in children aged 9 to 13, with differences in eating behaviors based on gender and BMI groups noted.
