Sepsis is a critical issue in healthcare, with high mortality rates and readmissions. Early identification is crucial, but challenging, especially in the prehospital setting where EMS plays a key role. Various Early Warning Scores (EWS) have been evaluated for prehospital sepsis identification, with qSOFA being commonly assessed. However, studies have shown inconsistent performance of EWS tools in this setting, indicating the need for standardized protocols and improved education. While some EWS may be useful, they should not be solely relied upon for sepsis identification. Future research should focus on standardizing prehospital care and interventions for sepsis patients to improve outcomes.
