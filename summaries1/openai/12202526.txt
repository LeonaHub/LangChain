A study was conducted on patients with dominantly inherited retinitis pigmentosa caused by mutations in the rhodopsin gene, with over 100 mutations identified. The severity of the disease varied based on the specific mutation, with milder cases associated with certain mutations. The study measured disease progression rates in 140 patients with progressive forms of the disease, finding that progression varied based on the region of the rhodopsin molecule affected by the mutation. The study used various methods to analyze ocular function, including visual acuity, visual field, and electroretinographic data. The results showed differences in disease severity based on the affected region, with mutations in the C terminus associated with more rapid progression. Factors beyond the gene defect, such as modifier genes or environmental factors, were suggested to influence disease progression. The study emphasized the importance of longitudinal studies for accurately measuring disease progression and highlighted the need to exclude outliers and floor effects in data analysis. The findings were supported by grants and published in a scientific journal.
