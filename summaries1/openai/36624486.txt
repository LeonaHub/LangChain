Dementia is a significant global health concern without a complete cure, leading to research on potential risk factors for prevention. Studies have linked brisk walking pace and lower grip strength to reduced dementia risk. Combining these factors may offer a stronger association with health outcomes. A study in the UK Biobank cohort of over 500,000 participants examined the individual and combined effects of walking pace and grip strength on new-onset dementia, including Alzheimer's and vascular dementia. The study also explored how age, genetic factors, family history of dementia, and modifiable risk factors could impact this relationship. Data collected included various health markers, lifestyle factors, and genetic risk scores, analyzed to investigate the link between these factors and cognitive health outcomes. The study found that faster walking pace and higher handgrip strength were associated with a lower risk of dementia, with the relationship potentially influenced by age and genetic risk. Limitations included self-reported data and limited generalizability. The findings underscore the importance of considering physical function, genetic factors, and age in assessing dementia risk.
