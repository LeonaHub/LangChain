The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) established a definition of pain in 1978, which has been widely accepted globally. However, recent discussions and criticisms have led to a revision of the definition due to advances in understanding pain. A Presidential Task Force was formed in 2018 to evaluate the current definition, resulting in recommendations for revisions that were unanimously accepted by the IASP Council. The revised definition of pain acknowledges its multidimensional nature and includes social, ethical, cognitive, and psychological factors. The task force aimed to create a clear and concise definition applicable to both humans and animals, emphasizing the subjective nature of pain experiences. The revised definition also addresses the distinction between pain and nociception, recognizing nociplastic pain as arising from altered nociception without clear evidence of tissue damage. The efforts to update pain classification align with the new edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), marking a significant step in recognizing pain as a health condition globally. The revised definition is intended to be a living document that evolves with advancements in the field.
