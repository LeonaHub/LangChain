Breast cancer incidence rates vary globally, with higher rates in Western countries and lower rates in regions like Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Different subtypes of breast cancer have distinct behaviors and responses to treatment, with African women often having aggressive subtypes like triple-negative breast cancer. Research in the U.S. has shown differences in breast cancer rates and survival among racial/ethnic groups, while studies in Europe on breast cancer subtypes among immigrant groups are limited. Socioeconomic status may contribute to disparities in breast cancer outcomes. A study in Norway analyzed breast cancer subtypes among immigrant groups from 2005 to 2015, finding differences in subtype distribution among immigrant women compared to non-immigrant women. Luminal A-like breast cancer was the most common subtype across all regions of birth, with variations in rates of HER2+ and triple-negative breast cancer among different immigrant groups. Factors such as genetics, lifestyle, health seeking behavior, and access to healthcare may contribute to these differences. The study highlights the importance of considering detailed subgroups in understanding breast cancer subtypes and their distribution among different populations, emphasizing the need to tailor preventive and screening strategies based on these differences.
