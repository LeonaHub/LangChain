A study in Taiwan analyzed the correlation between air pollutants and spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) using big data analysis methods. The study integrated various datasets, including the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), and analyzed patient data, air pollutant concentrations, and pollution levels in five regions. The analysis found correlations between certain air pollutants (CO, NO2, PM10, PM2.5, SO2, and O3) and sICH incidence, with some pollutants showing stronger correlations in specific age groups. PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 were identified as important risk factors for sICH in middle-aged and elderly patients, with NO2 being significant for patients over 80 years old. Despite efforts to control pollution levels, NO2 pollution remained correlated with sICH incidence. The study suggests that current air pollution control policies may not be sufficient to prevent health impacts and recommends further research to better understand the influence of air pollutants on sICH, including the consideration of laboratory data and temperature.
