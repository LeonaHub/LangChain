Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative brain disease and the leading cause of dementia, with significant public health concerns due to its impact on individuals, families, and society. The methylenetetrahydro-folate reductase (MTHFR) gene has been identified as a candidate gene associated with AD and other neurological conditions. Mutations in the MTHFR gene can lead to enzyme deficiency, causing hyperhomocysteinemia, which may contribute to DNA damage and neurotransmitter imbalances, exacerbating neurodegenerative disorders like AD. Genome-wide association studies suggest that impaired MTHFR enzyme activity increases the risk of AD and other neurological disorders. Additionally, exposure to chronic air pollution may further contribute to the development of AD by increasing inflammation and homocysteine levels. Meta-analyses have shown conflicting results regarding the association between MTHFR polymorphisms and AD, with some studies suggesting a link between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and vascular AD. The study aims to explore the association between MTHFR polymorphisms and AD in the context of gene-environment interactions, utilizing big-data analytic techniques to visualize distribution and patterns of MTHFR polymorphisms and AD risk. The study included a meta-analysis that found a significant association between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and AD risk across various geographic areas, with varying results
