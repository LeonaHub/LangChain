The text discusses the role of proteases and the protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR2) in lung cancer metastasis and progression. A study investigated the correlation between PAR2 promoter methylation and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cell behavior, finding a reverse correlation between methylation and gene expression. The study used various experiments like qRT-PCR, Western blot analysis, and cell assays to assess cell behavior. Results showed that hypomethylation of the PAR2 promoter was linked to high PAR2 expression and poor prognosis in LUAD patients. Inhibiting promoter methylation increased PAR2 expression and promoted cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. The text highlights the importance of biomarkers like PAR2 in predicting LUAD outcomes and suggests that PAR2 promoter hypomethylation and mRNA overexpression contribute to LUAD progression. It also discusses the role of PAR2 promoter methylation in gastric cancer and LUAD, emphasizing the potential therapeutic implications of targeting PAR2 promoter methylation in cancer treatment. Further research is needed to identify specific methylated sites affecting PAR2 promoter methylation for potential therapeutic interventions in LUAD.
