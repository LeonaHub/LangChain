Leishmaniasis is a group of diseases caused by parasites, with different strains leading to various levels of severity. Current treatments are limited in efficacy and have harmful side effects, prompting the need for new, more efficient drugs. Researchers have synthesized ergosterone-triazol hybrid molecules and tested their effects on Leishmania parasites, showing promising results. The compounds demonstrated dose-dependent growth inhibition on the parasites, inducing cell death through regulated cell death mechanisms. They also caused mitochondrial alterations, cell cycle arrest, and ultrastructural changes in the parasites. The compounds were found to increase reactive oxygen species levels and intracellular calcium release in the parasites, suggesting a potential for developing new drugs against leishmaniasis. The study highlights the unique effects of these compounds on Leishmania parasites and provides details on their synthesis and evaluation methods.
