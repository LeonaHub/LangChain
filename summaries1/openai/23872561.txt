Streptomyces bacteria, known for producing antibiotics, trigger antibiotic biosynthesis under phosphate limitation conditions. The ppk gene negatively controls this process, leading to energetic stress. A study analyzed proteomes of wild-type and ppk mutant strains, revealing the mutant's preference for lipid degradation over glucose catabolism. Various techniques were used to analyze protein samples and identify specific proteins. The mutant strain showed differential expression of proteins related to metabolic pathways, including carbon and glycolytic metabolism. The study also explored the impact of the ppk mutation on protein expression, revealing differences in nutrient uptake and stress response mechanisms compared to the wild-type strain. The mutant strain may combat oxidative stress through changes in protein expression levels. The study validated the hypothesis that the ppk mutant degrades triacylglycerols to produce acetyl-CoA, a precursor for antibiotic biosynthesis. Disruption of the ppk gene led to TAG degradation, resulting in antibiotic overproduction due to energetic stress. The text discusses the interplay between fatty acid metabolism and antibiotic biosynthesis, highlighting the importance of understanding these processes for developing new antibiotics.
