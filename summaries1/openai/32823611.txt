The text discusses the increasing global food demand due to population growth and changing diets, as well as the challenges to food security posed by climate change-induced flooding events. It emphasizes the importance of developing flood-tolerant crops to safeguard food production. The text delves into the role of ethylene signaling in promoting hypoxia tolerance in plants, particularly through the stabilization of ERFVII transcription factors and the induction of hypoxia adaptive genes. It highlights the significance of ethylene-induced accumulation of PGB1 and ERFVII in enhancing energy homeostasis and oxidative stress tolerance during hypoxia and re-oxygenation. The text also discusses the correlation between ethylene signaling, PGB1 levels, ERFVII levels, and hypoxia adaptive gene expression in promoting flooding tolerance in various plant species. Additionally, it mentions the potential for manipulating ethylene responsiveness to improve flooding tolerance in economically important crops like potato and tomato, which are typically intolerant to abiotic stresses. The study investigates how ethylene signaling influences hypoxia responses in different potato cultivars, with results showing that ethylene contributes to hypoxia acclimation in certain cultivars but not in others. The research suggests that understanding the mechanism of ethylene-mediated hypoxia acclimation could help uncover signaling pathways that confer flooding tolerance in crops. The study also highlights variations in waterlogging tolerance among elite potato cultivars and how ethylene signaling affects the transcriptional hypoxia response in potato roots. The research emphasizes the importance of studying genes involved in eth
