The Maillard reaction can lead to the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) like CML and CEL, which can accumulate in the body and contribute to diseases such as atherosclerosis and diabetes. Acrylamide, another compound from Maillard reactions, is considered a probable carcinogen. Dietary AGE restriction can help prevent certain diseases. Plant-based meat analogs (PBMA) are popular as vegetarian protein sources, but studies have found AGEs and acrylamide in them. A study analyzed CML, CEL, and acrylamide levels in 15 PBMA products and factors influencing their formation. The study aimed to reduce these compounds during PBMA production. Analytical methods involved UPLC-QqQ-MS/MS analysis and statistical analysis. PBMA had higher CML and CEL levels than raw meat, likely due to production processes. Acrylamide levels varied based on materials and processes. PBMA protein content and amino acid profile were found to be good substitutes for meat, with varying fatty acid profiles and sugar content. The study suggests using plant proteins high in methionine and cysteine and reducing oil to minimize acrylamide formation in PBMA. Future research will focus on reducing CML, CEL, and acrylamide in PBMA.
