The text discusses the association between aortic stenosis (AS) and acquired von-Willebrand disease (AVWD), particularly focusing on the role of Von Willebrand factor (VWF) in hemostasis and how AS can lead to VWF deficiency. A systematic review was conducted to investigate this relationship, with studies suggesting that increased shear stress from a stenotic aortic valve can result in acquired Von Willebrand deficiency Type 2A. The text also covers the pathophysiology of aortic stenosis, aortic valve sclerosis, and Heyde syndrome, emphasizing the impact of aortic valve surgery on correcting acquired Von Willebrand deficiency. Studies indicate that replacing the stenotic aortic valve can lead to a rapid recovery of VWF multimers and a decrease in bleeding risk. The text highlights the need for further research to fully understand the impact of VWF deficiency in AS patients and the importance of increased awareness among healthcare professionals regarding associated complications beyond anemia.
