Aortic intramural hematomas (AIH) are now considered thrombosed aortic dissections, typically affecting older females with cardiovascular risk factors, often in the descending aorta. Diagnosis is usually through CT scans, with MRI as an alternative. Treatment options include medical therapy or thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR), which can have complications like graft-related issues, stroke, and retrograde aortic dissection. A case study of a 58-year-old female with AIH type B is discussed, where TEVAR was initially performed, followed by open surgery due to complications, resulting in a successful outcome. The text also covers the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment options for AIH, including medical management and surgical interventions like TEVAR, with considerations for different stent-graft devices. TEVAR is a procedure used for aortic conditions, with potential complications such as obstruction, migration, infection, stroke, and more. The importance of careful patient selection, follow-up monitoring, and risk-benefit assessment before treatment is emphasized.
