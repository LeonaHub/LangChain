The text discusses the importance of physical activity for health and the recommendation of 10,000 steps per day for adults. It highlights that only half of Americans meet these guidelines, leading to health issues and high healthcare costs. Technology-based interventions, like Fitbit challenges incorporating social comparison, are seen as promising for increasing physical activity. The text describes three exploratory studies that examine the impact of engaging in Fitbit challenges on the daily steps of sedentary adults using single-case experimental designs. Results show that exposure to an active confederate may lead to greater engagement in physical activity challenges. However, individual and situational factors can influence how individuals respond to social comparison. The text suggests further research to explore these findings and address limitations, such as controlling for real-time similarity between participant and confederate steps. It concludes that competitive arrangements like Fitbit challenges can increase daily steps for some individuals, but effectiveness may vary based on participant learning history and contextual factors.
