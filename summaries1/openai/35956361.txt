The text discusses the importance of vitamin A (VA) for lactating women and infants, particularly in developing countries where VA deficiency is a public health issue. A study on urban lactating Chinese women investigated dietary VA intake, serum VA concentrations, and breast milk VA concentrations. Results showed that overweight or obese women had lower breast milk VA concentrations but higher serum VA concentrations, potentially indicating a risk of VA deficiency. Multiparous women were also found to have a higher risk of inadequate breast milk VA levels. The study highlighted the importance of adequate VA intake for the health of lactating women and their infants, emphasizing the role of dietary sources and potential deficiencies in VA status. Positive associations were found between dietary VA intake and serum and breast milk retinol levels. The study concluded that a significant proportion of lactating women did not meet recommended VA intake levels, particularly those who are overweight, obese, or have had multiple pregnancies.
