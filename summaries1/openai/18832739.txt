Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) are a group of myeloid cells that accumulate in large numbers in lymphoid tissues of tumor-bearing mice and individuals with infectious diseases. They are known for their ability to suppress T-cell responses and are considered a major factor in tumor-associated immune defects. A recent study aimed to identify specific subsets of MDSC responsible for immune suppression in various cancer models. The study evaluated different tumor models in mice and performed a phenotypic and functional analysis of MDSC subsets to understand their role in cancer-induced immune suppression. The study used flow cytometry, cell culture, isolation of cells, functional assays, and measurement of various cellular activities to analyze different subsets of MDSC. Results showed that granulocytic MDSC demonstrated more suppressive activity per cell basis, particularly at higher concentrations. Monocytic MDSC produced higher levels of NO, while granulocytic MDSC had higher levels of ROS. The study also examined the expression of inhibitory receptors on MDSC and found variability in their levels compared to immature myeloid cells (IMC). The expansion of MDSC was influenced by tumor-derived factors, and the study highlighted the need for further research to determine the specific factors responsible for MDSC expansion and their role in immune suppression. The text emphasizes the heterogeneous nature of MDSC and suggests that their immune suppressive activity in cancer is attributed to the entire population of these cells. Further investigation is recommended to clarify the exact mechanisms underlying the immune suppressive activity of different MDSC subsets.
