Primary Sj√∂gren's syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune disease that primarily affects exocrine glands, leading to symptoms like dry eyes and dry mouth. It predominantly affects females and can also involve extra-glandular symptoms such as pain, fatigue, and an increased risk of lymphoma. Patients with pSS often experience reduced quality of life and increased healthcare costs. Non-pharmacological interventions for pSS may include fatigue and mood management, patient education, occupational therapy, and acupuncture. While pharmacological treatments are commonly used, evidence supporting their efficacy is limited. A study aimed to assess the effects of non-pharmacological interventions for pSS in adults through randomized controlled trials, focusing on activities of daily living, participation outcomes, impairment of body functions, environmental factors, and personal factors. The review process involved searching electronic databases and references of included studies to identify relevant research articles. Five trials were included in the review, with varying interventions such as punctum plugs for dry eyes and intraoral lubricating devices for dry mouth. The studies had mixed results, with some showing improvements in certain outcomes but no significant differences in others. Overall, the quality of the included studies was deemed poor, with a high risk of bias and small sample sizes, calling for further well
