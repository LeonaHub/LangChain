The text discusses the global health issue of diabetes mellitus (DM) and its association with diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), a complication characterized by cardiac structural and functional disorders. Studies show that diabetes increases the risk of heart failure and cardiovascular complications, with cardiomyocyte apoptosis playing a significant role in DCM pathogenesis. Chronic hyperglycemia leads to oxidative stress in the heart, causing cardiomyocyte apoptosis and damage. The text highlights the potential therapeutic role of curcumin, an antioxidant compound, in protecting against high glucose-induced cardiac injury and inhibiting cardiomyocyte apoptosis. The study aims to elucidate curcumin's molecular mechanism by exposing primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes to high glucose concentrations. Various biochemical parameters and cellular processes were analyzed, showing that curcumin increased cell viability, decreased enzyme release, reduced apoptosis, and attenuated ROS generation. Curcumin also activated the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β signaling pathway, providing protection against high glucose-induced cardiac injury. The involvement of Akt in cardiovascular functions and its role in cell survival and growth were discussed, emphasizing the potential cardioprotective effects of curcumin through Akt and GSK-3β phosphorylation. Curcumin was shown to reduce oxidative stress and could be a potential treatment for DCM.
