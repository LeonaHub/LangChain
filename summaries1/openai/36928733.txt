The text provides a comprehensive overview of myoepithelioma and myoepithelial carcinoma in the head and neck region, detailing their characteristics, diagnosis, and differential diagnoses. Myoepithelioma is described as a rare benign salivary gland neoplasm composed of myoepithelial cells, while myoepithelial carcinoma is a malignant tumor with invasive growth. The importance of a comprehensive approach to differential diagnosis, including histology, immunohistochemistry, and potentially molecular studies, is emphasized. Various immunohistochemical markers are discussed for confirming myoepithelial differentiation. The text also covers other salivary gland tumors such as pleomorphic adenoma, oncocytoma, intercalated duct lesions, and soft tissue neoplasms like schwannoma, detailing their histological features and immunohistochemical profiles. Additionally, it addresses the challenges in distinguishing between different types of malignant neoplasms affecting the salivary glands and emphasizes the use of immunohistochemistry panels and molecular studies for accurate diagnosis and treatment guidance.
