Cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death globally, often starting with ventricular fibrillation. Survival rates drop quickly after cardiac arrest, highlighting the importance of prompt and effective CPR. A new approach called cross recurrence quantitative analysis (CRQA) allows for simultaneous analysis of electrical and mechanical heart activities. A study on pigs investigated the effects of ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest and CPR on ECG and PPG signals. The study used Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) and CRQA to analyze the dynamic coupling of ECG and PPG signals during different stages of CPR. Results showed significant differences in parameters across stages, indicating changes in electrical and mechanical coupling during CPR. The study suggests that these changes could serve as a physiological biomarker for evaluating CPR progress and prognosis. Further research and clinical studies with human subjects are recommended for future applications in clinical practice.
