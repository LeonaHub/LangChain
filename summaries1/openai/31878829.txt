Keloids are abnormal skin lesions characterized by excessive collagen production and capillary proliferation, more common in individuals with darker skin and believed to have a genetic basis. The molecular mechanisms involve hyper-proliferative fibroblasts, growth factors, and cytokines, with TGFβ playing a key role. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) like HOXA11-AS have been implicated in keloids, promoting cell survival and angiogenesis. A study at Henan People's Hospital investigated the role of HOXA11-AS in keloid formation, finding it regulates the miR-124-3p/TGFβR1 axis. The study involved cell culture experiments, histological examinations, and molecular analyses, showing an inverse regulation between miR-124-3p and HOXA11-AS or TGFβR1. The HOXA11-AS/miR-124-3p/TGFβR1 pathway was implicated in keloid formation through PI3K/Akt signaling. Targeting these molecules could be a potential therapy for keloids, though further research is needed to validate these findings.
