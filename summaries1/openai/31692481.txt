Gliomas are brain tumors classified by WHO tumor grade, with higher grades being more malignant. Treatment for high-grade gliomas includes surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, aiming to prolong life but impacting quality of life. Patient-centered outcomes, such as patient-reported outcomes (PROs), are increasingly used to assess treatment effects on function and quality of life. Survivorship care plans are important for managing symptoms and supporting patients and caregivers. Challenges in using PRO measures include concerns about methodological quality and missing data. Integrating PROs into clinical practice can improve patient care by enhancing communication, symptom control, and patient satisfaction. Specific PRO measures used in neuro-oncology survivorship care include HRQoL, fatigue, mood, functional status, cognitive status, seizure control, headache, and pain. Commonly used PRO measures include EORTC QLQ-C30, Fact-Br, and MDASI-BT. New technical solutions offer opportunities for remote data collection and real-time sharing, enhancing the use of PRO measures in improving patient outcomes and survivorship care.
