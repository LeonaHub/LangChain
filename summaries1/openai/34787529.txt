Bacterial meningitis in neonates is a serious condition with high mortality rates and long-term complications. Diagnosing neonatal bacterial meningitis can be challenging due to non-specific symptoms and high false-negative rates in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures. A study analyzed clinical data of 186 neonates with bacterial meningitis, finding that factors like older age at onset, higher fever peaks, longer fever durations, and more neurological symptoms and imaging abnormalities were associated with positive CSF culture results. Escherichia coli, Group B streptococcus, and Staphylococcus were commonly detected in positive CSF cultures. The study highlighted the importance of early diagnosis and aggressive therapy for neonatal bacterial meningitis, as well as the potential use of CSF protein levels as a marker for severe cases requiring intensive treatment. Further research is needed to confirm correlations and address study limitations.
