The text discusses the impact of endogenous hormones and environmental chemicals, such as BPA and genistein, on breast cancer risk. BPA is an endocrine disruptor that can increase the risk of mammary adenocarcinomas, while genistein, found in soy, has been associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer. Despite both having estrogenic properties, they regulate genes and proteins differently, leading to varied health outcomes. The study aimed to identify proteins affected by BPA and genistein exposure during lactation in rats, potentially serving as biomarkers for carcinogenesis susceptibility. The research focused on changes in the serum proteome following exposure to these chemicals, with findings suggesting early-life exposure can lead to permanent alterations in gene and protein expressions. The study utilized TMT-MS for biomarker analysis and identified differential protein expressions in rat sera exposed to BPA and genistein during the prepubertal period. The impact of BPA exposure on various proteins in mammary gland carcinogenesis was discussed, highlighting proteins that promote or inhibit cellular processes associated with cancer development. The text emphasizes the importance of further research to understand the implications of these protein alterations and suggests that quantitative proteomics via TMT-MS is valuable for identifying molecular targets and potential biomarkers of susceptibility to carcinogens.
