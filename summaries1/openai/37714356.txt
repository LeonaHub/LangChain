The text discusses the significant impact of biological invasions on biodiversity and human well-being, particularly focusing on the invasion process of non-native species through introduction, establishment, and dispersal phases. It highlights the role of globalization in promoting the introduction of non-native species and emphasizes the importance of managing introduction pathways to prevent invasions. The text uses the case study of pine wilt disease caused by pine wood nematodes to illustrate the economic and ecological impacts of invasive species, emphasizing the need for effective management strategies to control their spread. It also discusses the impact of climate change on the spread of the pine wood nematode in China, particularly through its insect vectors. The study aims to assess the invasion risk of the pine wood nematode by considering introduction pathways, interactions among the nematode, hosts, and insect vectors, and the influence of climate change. The text explores the potential geographical distribution of the pine wood nematode and its insect vectors in China, analyzing environmental variables, introduction pathways, and niche concepts. It discusses the shifting centroids of areas where the pine wood nematode overlaps with its insect vectors under different climate change scenarios and emphasizes the importance of assessing risks associated with the introduction, establishment, and dispersal of the nematode for effective management in China. The text proposes a comprehensive risk assessment framework for the pine wood nematode, considering introduction pathways, insect vectors, and host distribution to evaluate risks at different stages of invasion and suggests focusing on biological control agents and strengthening early warning and prevention measures in high-risk areas.
