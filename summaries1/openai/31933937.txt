The text discusses the role of DLC-3, a Rho-GAP, in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and its potential interactions with the Wnt signaling pathway. The study involved analyzing DLC-3 expression in TNBC samples through various assays and analyses, showing that low DLC-3 expression was associated with metastasis and histologic grade. Overexpression of DLC-3 was found to inhibit cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion in breast cancer cells. The text suggests that DLC-3 may act as a tumor-suppressor gene in TNBC and explores its regulation of the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway. Further research is needed to understand the molecular mechanisms and downstream targets of DLC-3 in TNBC and its potential as a therapeutic target.
