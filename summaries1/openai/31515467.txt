The text discusses a study on the circular RNA circ_0079993 and its role in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. The study involved analyzing the expression of circ_0079993 and its parental gene POLR2J4 in CRC samples, investigating the impact of circ_0079993 knockdown on CRC cell growth, and exploring its interactions with microRNAs and genes in CRC. Results showed that circ_0079993 was highly expressed in CRC tissues, associated with poor prognosis, and its knockdown inhibited CRC cell growth. The study identified interactions between circ_0079993, miRNAs, and genes in CRC cells, highlighting the involvement of circ_0079993 in regulating the expression of CREB1 by sponging miR-203a-3p.1. The findings suggest that circ_0079993 could be a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in CRC. Further research is needed to uncover additional functional mechanisms of circ_0079993 in CRC and understand the complex circRNA regulation networks in CRC pathogenesis.
