Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a radiation-free imaging technique that directly measures the magnetic moments of magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) using an alternating magnetic field. While MPI offers high sensitivity and temporal resolution, it requires combination with other imaging modalities for anatomical information. Tracers like Resovist速 are commonly used in MPI studies, but there is a need for new tracers with better properties. The text discusses the synthesis and characterization of multicore particles (MCP) as potential MPI tracers, highlighting their biocompatibility and biodegradability. The study evaluates the MPI signal properties of MCP compared to Resovist速 in phantom experiments using a preclinical MPI scanner. The text details the materials and methods used for synthesizing and characterizing MCP, including techniques like dynamic light scattering and magnetic particle spectroscopy. The study aims to optimize the reconstruction process and evaluate the performance of different tracers in MPI imaging. MCP 3, a type of MNP, shows promising results as an MPI tracer, outperforming Resovist速 in various characteristics such as signal strength, selectivity, and spatial resolution. The text also discusses the potential challenges of using Resovist速 due to its shadowing effect. Overall, MCP 3 is considered a high-performance MPI tracer with superior
