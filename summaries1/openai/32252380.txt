The text emphasizes the importance of energy-saving and environmentally friendly industries, particularly in the context of lightweight high-speed vehicles. It discusses the use of high-strength steel sandwich panels for these vehicles and the challenges faced in welding T-joints using laser welding methods. To address these challenges, a flux bands constricting arc (FBCA) welding method is proposed. The text reviews previous studies on ultra-narrow gap welding methods and emphasizes the need for further research on arc behavior and the effect of flux bands on welding arcs to improve welding processes. The study methodology involves high-speed camera systems, arc contour extraction methods, infrared temperature testing systems, and real-time electric signal acquisition systems. The experimental setup and procedures for Flux-Cored Arc Welding (FBCA) are described, focusing on process parameters, arc behaviors, and stability. The text also delves into the composition and behavior of materials involved in FBCA welding, the impact of welding process parameters, and the influence of flux bands on arc behavior and stability. It compares the arc shapes in gas metal arc welding (GMAW) and FBCA processes in ultra-narrow gaps, highlighting the stabilizing effect of flux bands on the arc shape. The impact of flux bands on arc heating, side-wall penetration, metal transfer characteristics, and arc stability in FBCA welding is discussed, with quantitative analysis showing improvements in arc stability with flux bands. Overall, the text underscores the significance of flux bands in enhancing arc stability and regulating heat distribution
