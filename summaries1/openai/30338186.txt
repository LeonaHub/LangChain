The text discusses the use of the IllumiScan fluorescence visualization device for detecting oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and leukoplakia in patients. The study compared IllumiScan with other methods like narrow band imaging (NBI) and Lugolâ€™s iodine staining method (IOM) in detecting oral cancers and precancerous lesions. The study protocol followed ethical guidelines and used Image J software to analyze fluorescence visualization images. Results showed differences in ROI areas and G values for OSCC and leukoplakia, with specific cutoff values identified. The text also mentions the clinical application of IllumiScan in diagnosing epithelial dysplasia and cancer lesions, highlighting its sensitivity and specificity. Challenges in distinguishing normal areas and leukoplakia were noted, along with the potential of combining IllumiScan with other methods for improved diagnostic accuracy.
