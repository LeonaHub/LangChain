Bumblebee populations globally, especially in North America, are declining due to factors like neonicotinoid pesticide use. These pesticides harm pollinators and contaminate floral resources, threatening wild pollinator populations. A study focused on the chronic toxicity effects of clothianidin, a neonicotinoid, on queen, worker, and male bumblebees. Results showed that males were more vulnerable to clothianidin, with differences in gene expression responses between workers and males. The study highlighted the importance of considering different sexes and castes in assessing pesticide risks on bumblebee populations. Neonicotinoid consumption can impact bee reproduction genes, and workers and males respond differently to exposure. The research emphasizes the need to understand neonicotinoid effects on pollinator health and biodiversity.
