Interferons (IFNs) are classified into three families: type I (IFN-α/β), type II (IFN-γ), and type III (IFN-λ). Type I and type III IFNs are potent antiviral cytokines, while type II IFN connects the innate and adaptive immune systems. The IFNL4 gene, involved in hepatitis C virus (HCV) clearance, has a frameshift mutation associated with higher HCV clearance rates but lower liver inflammation and fibrosis. IFN-λ4, despite antiviral activity in vitro, has a proviral and anti-inflammatory effect in vivo. Studies show minimal IFNL4 mRNA expression in infected patients, with stronger expression of canonical IFNL3. The IFNL4 promoter is functional but has significantly lower expression compared to IFNL1 and IFNB1 upon viral infection. The study explores the unique genetic characteristics of the IFNL4 gene, its low expression levels, and its distinct response to viral infection compared to canonical IFNs. The IFNL4 promoter requires different factors for activation compared to IFNL1. The study also examines the evolutionary conservation of IFNL4 promoter activity and its distinctiveness across mammalian species. The IFNL4 promoter contains nonfunctional IRF binding sites but functional NF-κB sites, affecting its response to viral infection. The study suggests that the IFNL4 gene is a noncanonical member of the type III IFN family, uniquely regulated among mammals. Experimental methods involved assays on IFNL4 and IFNL1 promoter chimeras, luciferase assays, ChIP assays, and gene expression analysis. The study concludes that the IFNL4 gene is regulated uniquely and responds differently to stimuli compared to canonical IFNs.
