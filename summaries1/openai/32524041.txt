A study was conducted on six subjects with drug-resistant epilepsy who were implanted with the RNS System to investigate the effects of neurostimulation on sleep. The study found that RNS System stimulations did not significantly disrupt sleep in these subjects, with arousals tending to occur before stimulations. The study aimed to correlate sleep features observed on polysomnography with intracranial recordings obtained through the RNS System and provided insights into the complex relationships between epileptiform activity, arousals, and neurostimulation in patients with epilepsy. The text highlights the potential clinical advantage of RNS System neurostimulation over other modalities if confirmed in larger studies and emphasizes the need for further research to better understand the effects of RNS System stimulation on sleep. The study acknowledges limitations such as small sample size and variability in lead placements and stimulation pathways among subjects, suggesting the need for larger studies to understand the effects of neurostimulation on sleep in patients with epilepsy.
