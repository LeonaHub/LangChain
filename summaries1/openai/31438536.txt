The text discusses the importance of sucrose transport in maize and the role of acid invertases in regulating plant growth and development, particularly under drought stress conditions. It introduces a new maize invertase inhibitor, Zm-INVINH4, which is expressed in response to drought stress and modulates source-to-sink growth in maize. The study characterizes Zm-INVINH4 through sequence analysis, phylogenetic comparisons, cloning, recombinant protein expression, functional analysis, and expression pattern in different maize tissues under drought and ABA stress. The research shows that Zm-INVINH4 functions as an invertase inhibitor, reducing invertase activity in cell wall and vacuolar enzymes, and is targeted to the apoplast. The gene is expressed in both vegetative and reproductive tissues, with high expression in leaves and young kernels. The study also examines the activities of cell wall and vacuolar invertases, as well as the accumulation of soluble sugars in response to drought stress in maize tissues. The research suggests that Zm-INVINH4 modulates invertase-related processes in maize growth and development under drought stress, potentially offering insights for improving productivity and preventing drought-induced seed abortion in maize. The study involved experimentation with Zea mays L. plants and potato plants, including RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis,
