The text discusses the increasing trend of pet ownership in South Korea due to demographic changes and lifestyle preferences, highlighting the potential positive impact of companion animals on human health and well-being. It emphasizes the need for more comprehensive research on the relationship between pet ownership and human health in South Korea. A study conducted in Seoul, South Korea, examined the association between companion animal ownership and overall life satisfaction, finding that pet owners generally reported higher levels of life satisfaction. The study also found differences in life satisfaction levels based on the number and type of pets owned, with owners of both dogs and cats reporting the highest life satisfaction scores. The study recommended future research to consider sample characteristics and cultural differences, as well as the number and types of pets owned. Limitations of the study included its cross-sectional design and the small number of participants with multiple pets, suggesting the importance of considering the duration and history of pet ownership in future research.
