Eosinophils are crucial in inflammatory processes, particularly in conditions like bronchial asthma, with their differentiation influenced by cytokines like interleukin-5. They express various receptors and effector functions, releasing mediators that induce inflammation and tissue damage. Eosinophils are involved in innate and adaptive immune responses, acting as effector cells during parasite infections and allergic inflammation. The text discusses the complex biology of eosinophils, highlighting the role of cytokines, chemokines, and biologics like benralizumab in regulating eosinophil biology and inflammation. Benralizumab, a monoclonal antibody, targets IL-5Rα to inhibit IL-5 binding and induce eosinophil apoptosis, reducing eosinophils at the bronchial level. The text also mentions safety concerns regarding eosinophil depletion through treatments like benralizumab, particularly in relation to protection against parasites, viruses, and tumors. The impact of eosinophil depletion on tumor development and anti-cancer immunity is still unclear. Benralizumab's mechanism involves inhibiting IL-5 and enhancing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity on IL-5Rα-expressing cells, targeting eosinophils in asthma. Long-term analysis of adverse effects from benralizumab treatment has shown a safety profile similar to shorter-term trials. Ongoing research is needed to further understand the role of eosinophils and the IL-5/IL-5α axis in inflammatory diseases like asthma, as
