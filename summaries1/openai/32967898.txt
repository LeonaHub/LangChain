Influenza viruses cause numerous global deaths annually, particularly affecting the elderly. In the United States, seasonal influenza leads to a high number of healthcare visits and costs. Rapid and accurate diagnosis is crucial for treatment and prevention. A study in Los Angeles used the Sofia influenza A+B FIA test in outpatient clinics to predict influenza activity in emergency departments, dividing clinics into zones based on neighborhoods and zip codes. The study aimed to forecast influenza cases in the emergency department using outpatient data, finding that an increase in outpatient cases preceded a surge in the emergency department by 1-3 weeks. The text underscores the significance of early prediction for effective infection prevention and resource allocation, suggesting the use of rapid testing and data tracking in healthcare settings. The study highlights the potential of Virena software for real-time tracking and prediction of influenza cases, with future directions including incorporating other respiratory viruses like RSV.
