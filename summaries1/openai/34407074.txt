The text emphasizes the importance of structure and composition in arthropod communities, particularly in relation to plant communities, for effective pest control strategies in agriculture. It discusses the influence of plant characteristics on arthropod abundance and diversity, as well as the challenges in measuring diversity consistently. The research aims to investigate the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of insect populations in farmland ecosystems to provide insights for pest control strategies. The study conducted in Dehui, Northeast China, focused on the biodiversity of aphid and ant communities in herbicide-tolerant corn fields, collecting and identifying numerous insect species. The text highlights the significance of natural enemies in pest control and the dynamic changes in insect populations throughout corn growth stages. It also discusses the relationship between farmland diversity, growth stages of corn, and human factors, noting the instability of farmland diversity due to single planting structures like corn. The study underscores the importance of understanding spatial relationships between insect communities in farmland for self-regulation and pest control, while acknowledging the need for further research to enhance conclusions.
