The text discusses common infectious diseases in children, such as purulent conjunctivitis, acute otitis media, and acute bacterial paranasal sinusitis, focusing on the Conjunctivitis-Otitis Media Syndrome and the predominant pathogens involved, particularly Haemophilus influenzae. The study investigates the etiology, clinical features, antibiotic susceptibility patterns, and associations of these conditions in children, noting the occurrence of co-infections and clusters within households. The study found a link between conjunctivitis, otitis media, and sinusitis, suggesting a potential "conjunctivitis–otitis media–sinusitis syndrome" with a shared pathogenic process, primarily involving H. influenzae. The text also highlights the impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination, the virulence of H. influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae in different conditions, and the challenges in determining transmission rates and antibiotic resistance. The study emphasizes the need for effective vaccines against non-typeable H. influenzae infections and provides updated information on the association of H. influenzae with these infectious diseases in children.
