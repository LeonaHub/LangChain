Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI IMS) combines mass spectrometry with histology to visualize biomolecules in tissue. This technology has been used to analyze various analyte classes like pharmaceuticals, metabolites, lipids, peptides, and proteins. MALDI IMS involves cutting tissue sections, coating them with a MALDI matrix, and irradiating them with a laser to generate mass spectra. Protein imaging in MALDI IMS faces challenges in identifying observed peaks, limiting contextualization with biological processes. Protein identification strategies include bottom-up, top-down, and indirect methods. Further development is needed to enhance image quality and sensitivity in MALDI IMS experiments. Fourier transform mass spectrometers like FTICR and Orbitrap provide high resolution and accuracy, aiding in tissue analysis and reducing false positive identifications. MALDI FTICR MS has been used to generate intact protein images with unprecedented mass accuracy, enabling confident identifications. The text also discusses the use of MALDI FTICR IMS for protein imaging experiments, showcasing its high mass resolution capabilities. The study of S100A8 proteoforms in kidney tissue of mice infected with Staphylococcus aureus demonstrates the potential of MALDI FTICR IMS in providing insights into host defense proteins. The text also highlights the importance of understanding protein modifications in infection biology, particularly oxidative damage on proteins like S100A8. Further research is needed to validate findings and comprehend the role of oxidation at the host-pathogen interface. Challenges in detecting larger proteins in tissue using MALDI FTICR IMS technology are discussed, emphasizing the need for new methods and high-resolution instrumentation for confident identifications.
