The text discusses the impact of radiation exposure on vascular endothelium in radiosensitive organs, emphasizing the importance of rescuing normal endothelial integrity for survival in acute radiation syndromes and the development of delayed effects of acute radiation exposure (DEARE). It focuses on the role of Delta-like ligand 4 (Dll4) in mediating radiation-induced alterations in vascular structure and function, particularly in the context of DEARE. The text describes studies involving consomic rat models with reduced Dll4 expression to evaluate radiation-induced cardiotoxicity and vascular dysfunction using imaging techniques. In vivo and ex vivo assays on rats were conducted to investigate the role of Dll4 in mediating vascular dysfunction and survival post-radiation injury. The study utilized imaging techniques, such as near-infrared (NIR) imaging and MRI, to monitor the effects of radiation on pulmonary and renal endothelial cells. The study also involved in vitro studies on rat lung endothelial cells to assess changes in endothelial cell and Dll4 expression post-radiation. Results showed that rats with lower Dll4 expression had improved survival and protection against vascular injury compared to rats with higher Dll4 expression, suggesting that decreased endothelial expression of Dll4 plays a role in radioprotection. The study indicates that Dll4 may be a therapeutic target for suppressing pathological vascular remodeling following radiation injury. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms behind long-term endothelial dysfunction after radiation.
