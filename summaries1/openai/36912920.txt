Popliteal cysts, also known as Baker's cysts, are often associated with knee joint pathologies leading to fluid accumulation, causing symptoms like pain and limited motion. Traditional treatments had high recurrence rates, but arthroscopic surgery now addresses cyst wall, valve, and intra-articular issues simultaneously. A study on this technique showed low recurrence rates and improved functional outcomes, especially in patients with severe chondral lesions. The importance of addressing concomitant intra-articular lesions to reduce cyst recurrence was highlighted. The study emphasized the safety and efficacy of arthroscopic treatment, despite limitations like varied follow-up times. Overall, arthroscopic excision of popliteal cysts was found to be effective in reducing recurrence and improving functional outcomes.
