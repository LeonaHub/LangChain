The male reproductive tract consists of various components such as the testis, excurrent ductules, and accessory glands like the prostate and seminal vesicle. The epididymis, a crucial part of the excurrent ductules, is responsible for sperm maturation, transport, and storage. Water movement in the epididymis is facilitated by aquaporins (AQPs), which regulate water transport across cell membranes. Hormones like androgen and estrogen influence the expression of different types of AQPs in the epididymis. Nandrolone decanoate (ND), a steroidal compound, can impact male fertility by altering steroidogenic enzymes in the testis. A study investigated the effects of ND treatment on the expression of Aqp1 and Aqp9 in different segments of the rat epididymis over 2 or 12 weeks. The research found segment-specific regulation of Aqp1 and Aqp9 expression by ND, with varying effects at different doses and durations of treatment. The abnormal expression of these aquaporins due to ND treatment may lead to infertility by affecting sperm development. Further research is recommended to understand the detailed molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of Aqp1 and Aqp9 expression in the epididymis by ND and hormonal factors.
