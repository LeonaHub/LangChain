Orthodontic patients often experience anxiety and pain during treatment, affecting compliance. Pain can be managed with pharmacological or nonpharmacological methods, with preemptive analgesia being effective. A study compared the effectiveness of chewing gum and tenoxicam for pain relief after archwire placement in 42 female participants. Both interventions reduced pain over time, with similar patterns of pain intensity. The study found no significant difference in pain management between the two groups, suggesting chewing gum as a non-pharmacological alternative for orthodontic pain control. Further research is needed to establish a standard pain management protocol in orthodontic treatment.
