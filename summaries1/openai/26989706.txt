The text discusses the rising prevalence of asthma and allergies in developed countries, focusing on the role of innate immunity and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in recognizing respiratory pathogens. Studies have linked TLR2 polymorphism to susceptibility to asthma and allergies. The text describes a study investigating the impact of asthma on TLR2 expression in peripheral blood and sputum leukocytes, with newly-diagnosed asthmatic adults as subjects. The study measured sTLR2 levels, total IgE, eosinophil counts, and TLR2 mRNA expression in serum and sputum samples using ELISA and RT-PCR. Results showed lower sTLR2 levels in asthmatics, higher total IgE concentrations, and reduced TLR2 mRNA expression in sputum leukocytes of asthmatic patients. The study suggests that the asthmatic lung environment may down-regulate TLR2 expression and proposes sTLR2 levels as a potential marker for asthma severity, calling for further research on sTLR2's role in allergic asthma pathogenesis and clinical manifestations.
