The text discusses the use of oral anticoagulant therapy, including traditional anticoagulants like warfarin and newer direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) such as dabigatran and rivaroxaban, for conditions like atrial fibrillation and deep vein thrombosis. It presents a study evaluating preventable bleeding cases associated with oral anticoagulants reported in the Campania region from 2012 to 2017, analyzing factors like age, gender, seriousness, outcomes, and causality assessment of bleeding cases related to different types of anticoagulants. The study classified gastrointestinal bleedings and compared the risk of these bleedings associated with different drugs, using dabigatran as a reference. It also assessed the seriousness and outcomes of adverse drug reactions, causality using the Naranjo algorithm, and preventability using the P-method. The study found that a significant percentage of bleeding cases were preventable, often due to dose-related mechanisms, and required pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for management. The text also discusses the risks of drug interactions involving oral anticoagulants, emphasizing the importance of healthcare professionals being aware of potential interactions to prevent adverse drug reactions. The study highlights the need for improved pharmacovigilance activities to reduce medication errors and inappropriate prescriptions related to oral anticoagulant therapy.
