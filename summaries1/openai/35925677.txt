Soybean is a valuable global crop used for food, fuel, and feed, but faces economic threats from microbial diseases like charcoal rot caused by Macrophomina phaseolina. In Argentina, biocontrol strategies using bacteria have shown promise in reducing disease incidence. Various Colletotrichum species also impact soybean production, producing metabolites with biological activities. The text details the biosynthesis, structural determination, and potential activities of these metabolites, such as higginsianins A and B, colletochlorins E and F, and truncatenolide and truncatenone. Methods for purification, characterization, and derivatization of these compounds are discussed, along with their molecular structures and properties analyzed using spectroscopic and computational techniques. Antifungal activities of these metabolites against M. phaseolina are highlighted. Truncatenolide and truncatenone were isolated from C. truncatum, with truncatenolide showing phytotoxic and antifungal properties. Truncatenone stimulated seed root growth. The text also mentions the antifungal activities of other compounds like modiolide A and pinolidoxin. Further research is needed to fully understand the fungicidal potential of these compounds.
