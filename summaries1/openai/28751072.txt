The text discusses the hierarchical composition of tooth dentin and the importance of understanding its mechanical properties, focusing on hardness tests like reference point indentation (RPI) technique. A study compared microhardness measurements of coronal dentin using RPI and traditional Knoop methods, analyzing dentin microstructure and chemical composition. Results showed higher hardness in superficial dentin, confirming a decrease towards deep dentin. The BioDent RPI technique was found accurate and less variable than Knoop, with less impact from the indentation size effect. Factors influencing ISE were discussed, along with the positive relationship between mineral content and hardness. The study also analyzed the degree of crystallinity and carbonate content in dentin, showing a correlation with hardness and suggesting a gradient biocomposite material with varying properties.
