Frozen shoulder, or adhesive capsulitis, affects 2-5% of the population and is characterized by shoulder pain and reduced range of movement. The causes are not well understood, but diabetes is a known risk factor. A study used UK Biobank data to conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic variants associated with frozen shoulder. Mendelian randomization was then used to investigate causal relationships between diabetes, obesity, and frozen shoulder. The study identified significant loci and found an association between diabetes and frozen shoulder, particularly with type 1 diabetes. The study also explored overlaps with Dupuytren's disease and potential causal genes like WNT7B, MMP14, and SFRP4. Further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms of frozen shoulder, especially in different ethnic groups. Individuals with diabetes, especially type 1 diabetes and poor glycemic control, are at higher risk of developing frozen shoulder. The study acknowledges limitations in coding accuracy and generalizability to other populations. Overall, the research provides valuable insights into the genetic and biological aspects of frozen shoulder.
