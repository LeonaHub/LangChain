The text discusses the accumulation patterns and impacts of bioactive compounds in barley grains, particularly under high-temperature conditions. Various compounds like dietary fiber, phenolic compounds, tocols, sterols, and folates in barley have health benefits such as maintaining cholesterol levels and reducing the risk of diseases. The study aims to understand the dynamics of these compounds under heat stress to enhance the nutritional quality of barley. Factors like genotype, environmental conditions, and stress influence the deposition patterns of these compounds, with genotypic differences being more significant than environmental effects. The research highlights the complex interactions between genetic traits, environmental factors, and stress on the biochemical components in barley grains. Heat stress can affect the levels of compounds like arabinoxylan, anthocyanin, and phenolic compounds, with genotypes like Tamalpais and Hindukusch showing higher antioxidant capacity. The study emphasizes the importance of genetic factors in determining the bioactive compound content in barley grains and suggests that harvesting non-mature grains early in high-temperature areas may maximize antioxidant capacity for food barley ingredients.
