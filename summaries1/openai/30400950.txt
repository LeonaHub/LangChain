Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal lung disease that requires early diagnosis for effective treatment. Forced vital capacity (FVC) is crucial in predicting disease progression and mortality in IPF, but may not detect small changes in fibrosis progression. Functional respiratory imaging (FRI) using CT scans can provide detailed assessment of lung function. A study analyzed FRI parameters in IPF patients to predict FVC decline, finding correlations between declining FVC and FRI parameters like lung volumes and fibrotic tissue. FRI was more sensitive in detecting changes compared to traditional FVC measurements. Another study discussed an automated method for quantifying traction bronchiectasis in IPF patients, highlighting its significance in disease severity and mortality prediction. FRI parameters were found to be more sensitive in detecting disease progression than traditional tests, emphasizing the importance of quantifying regional lung structures for monitoring and understanding IPF progression.
