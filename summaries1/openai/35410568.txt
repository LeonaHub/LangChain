The text discusses the increasing incidence of cancer in Japan and the availability of effective cancer treatments, leading to a surge in new oncology drugs and associated treatment costs. Despite the High-Cost Medical Expense Benefit system, some oncology patients face economic burdens. A study in Japan involving physicians treating chronic myeloid leukemia and transplant-ineligible multiple myeloma patients found that treatment costs influence treatment decisions, with some patients receiving non-optimal treatment due to cost. Physician characteristics like age and facility type also impact recommendations for non-optimal treatment. Treatment cost can affect patient adherence and outcomes, with some patients refusing or discontinuing treatment due to cost concerns. The study suggests that while treatment cost may not always lead to non-optimal treatment, it can be a significant factor for some patients, particularly the elderly and retired. Further research is needed to understand the impact of treatment cost on patient decisions.
