The text discusses the challenges dentists face with clinically unacceptable crowns from laboratories, leading to remakes that consume time and resources. Factors contributing to crown remakes include misfits and esthetic failures. A study aimed to investigate clinical remake rates for crowns and their association with various factors in dental practice, involving 205 dentists and 3847 patients. The study found a 3.8% crown rejection rate, with factors like years in practice, busyness, and insurance status influencing crown fit. Other studies showed differences in remake rates based on impression techniques and the impact of clinician standards on remake rates. Patient demographics indicated higher education and income levels, with factors like clinician experience and communication breakdowns with laboratories affecting crown success. The study identified limitations and suggested further analysis of material and technique factors to predict crown success.
