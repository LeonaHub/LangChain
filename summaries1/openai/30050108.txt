Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene, leading to varying levels of severity. Over 900 mutations have been identified in the PAH gene, with some mutations correlating with specific forms of PKU. A study in China analyzed 1104 patients, identifying 203 mutations and categorizing patients into different PKU phenotypes based on plasma phenylalanine levels. The study found a high degree of heterogeneity in PKU mutations, with classic PKU being the most common phenotype. Certain mutations were associated with mild hyperphenylalaninemia (MHP) or classical PKU (cPKU) based on predicted enzyme activity levels. The study also highlighted inconsistencies between predicted deleterious mutations and observed phenotypes, suggesting the influence of genetic background and modifier genes. Further research is needed to understand these correlations and inconsistencies. The study obtained ethical approvals and parental consents, adhering to the Declaration of Helsinki.
