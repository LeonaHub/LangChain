Haldane's Rule states that in hybrid offspring of different animal races, the heterogametic sex is more likely to be absent, rare, or sterile. This rule has been observed in birds, where females are the heterogametic sex. The mechanisms behind Haldane's Rule are debated, with explanations including dominance theory and the "Large X-effect." In birds, the faster evolution of Z-linked genes compared to autosomal genes may contribute to reproductive isolation. Research on introgression rates in avian species supports Haldane's Rule, with lower introgression rates for Z-linked loci. Factors influencing introgression patterns include genetic drift, lack of recombination, and sex-specific differences. Studies highlight the importance of genetic loci in maintaining reproductive isolation and the challenges in estimating hybrid fitness accurately. Exceptions to Haldane's Rule have been observed, such as in mallard and spot-billed duck hybridization. Recent research focuses on identifying loci involved in reproductive isolation rather than estimating introgression rates. Future studies could explore how introgression rates in specific genomic regions relate to fitness components, shedding light on the genetic mechanisms of Haldane's Rule. The W-chromosome presents an opportunity for further research into genetic incompatibilities between species. Improving genomic resources and methods can enhance understanding of introgression patterns and their impact on evolutionary processes.
