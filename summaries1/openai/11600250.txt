The text discusses the role of cytokines, particularly Interleukin-6 (IL-6), in mediating immune and inflammatory responses. It explains the production and regulation of IL-6, as well as its effects on various systems in the body. The text also mentions acute phase proteins and their role in the inflammatory response, as well as the potential effects of Trypsin-Chymotrypsin preparation on reducing inflammation by modulating IL-1β and IL-6 expression. A study was conducted on burn patients to observe changes in serum IL-1β and IL-6 levels after administration of Trypsin-Chymotrypsin. The study involved drug administration, serum sample collection, and cytokine analysis using ELISA kits. The study focused on clinical parameters such as oedema, inflammation, pain, wound epithelialization, and sepsis in burn patients. Results showed changes in circulatory IL-1β and IL-6 levels post-burn injury, with significant differences observed in serum levels between different groups. Treatment with Trypsin-Chymotrypsin reduced cytokine levels, improved wound healing, and stabilized cytokine levels, suggesting potential benefits in reducing morbidity and mortality in burn patients. The study highlighted the importance of measuring cytokine levels, particularly IL-6, in burn injuries and proposed inhibiting
