Preterm birth is a common issue in twin pregnancies, with a higher risk compared to singleton pregnancies. Identifying twin pregnancies at risk of preterm birth is crucial, especially for those with a history of prior preterm birth. Cervical length screening and softness assessment are important factors in predicting preterm delivery in twin pregnancies. Ultrasound elastography, specifically shear wave elastography (SWE), is a promising tool for evaluating cervical softness. A prospective cohort study conducted at Ramathibodi Hospital in Thailand measured cervical SWE in both twin and singleton pregnancies. The study found that cervical softness progressed with gestational age in both types of pregnancies, with twin pregnancies showing significantly lower softness in the mid-trimester compared to singletons at the lower point of the cervix. However, there was no difference in softness at the upper point. The study suggests that SWE is a promising method for evaluating cervical tissue stiffness, but further research is needed to evaluate its potential for preterm surveillance in twin pregnancies.
