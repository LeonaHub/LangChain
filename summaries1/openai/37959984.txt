Biodegradable polymers like poly-Îµ-caprolactone (PCL) are widely used in tissue engineering due to their biocompatibility and versatility. Electrospinning is a common method for creating non-woven nanofiber scaffolds, including vascular grafts, with adjustable properties. However, challenges like graft mineralization can arise, impacting the success of tissue engineering. A study focused on analyzing electrospun PCL grafts in a rat abdominal aorta replacement model over 180 days to evaluate their performance and long-term effects. The study included details on polymer composition, scaffold fabrication, and analysis methods like scanning electron microscopy. In vivo experiments on rats involved scaffold observation, sterilization, implantation, postoperative care, and monitoring. The study used various imaging techniques to analyze structural changes in the PCL scaffolds over time, observing cell responses and complications like neointimal hyperplasia and scaffold mineralization. The study highlighted the importance of scaffold biodegradation and cellularization for long-term performance, emphasizing the need for further research. The findings showed histological reactions like graft encapsulation, chronic inflammation, and scaffold degradation with remodeling and vitalization, with some implants showing signs of chondroid metaplasia. The study underscored the significance of understanding cell differentiation in remodeling artificial vascular prostheses and the necessity for additional research on the involved mechanisms.
