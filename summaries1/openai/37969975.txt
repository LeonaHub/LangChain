The text discusses various studies on the use of chitosan nanoparticles loaded with different substances for breast cancer treatment. These nanoparticles are designed to enhance drug delivery, reduce toxicity, and improve anticancer effects. The studies involve the encapsulation of antitumor agents like betaine, nedaplatin, betulin, and norcantharidin in chitosan nanoparticles, some of which are PEGylated for improved efficacy. The experiments include in vitro and in vivo evaluations, such as cytotoxicity tests on MCF-7 cells and tumor size reduction in breast cancer rat models. Results show that PEGylation enhances drug release, cytotoxicity, and antitumor activity, suggesting that these nanoformulations could be a promising therapeutic approach for breast cancer treatment.
