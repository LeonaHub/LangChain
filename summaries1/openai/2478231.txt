The text discusses the heterogeneity of the γ chain of human plasma fibrinogen, specifically focusing on the molecular weight and amino acid sequence variations at the C-terminus. It identifies three forms of the γ chain (γ50, γ55, and γ57.5) and explores their differences, with γ55 likely being a post-translationally modified shorter version of γ57.5. The composition of purified variant γ chain fibrinogens is described as heterodimeric, while the predominant form is homodimeric. The text delves into the functional significance of the C-terminal end of the γ chain in fibrin formation and platelet aggregation, as well as the effects of monoclonal antibodies and synthetic peptides on platelet function. Various experiments are detailed, including peptide synthesis, purification, amino acid analysis, antibody preparation, and fibrinogen purification. The text also discusses the binding of MoAb L2B to different forms of fibrin, demonstrating specificity for the γ57.5408-416 sequence. Platelet function studies, the impact of Aα chain degradation on fibrinogen γ57.5 platelet aggregation support, and the role of specific peptide sequences in platelet-fibrinogen interactions are explored. The study concludes by emphasizing the importance of specific sequences within the γ chain in supporting platelet aggregation, with the L2B epitope identified to include residues R-409-PEH-412. The secondary structure analysis indicates an α-helical forming structure for γ57.5408-416, unlike the lack of secondary structure in the C-terminal portion of γ50. The study suggests a structure for crosslinked fibrin γ chain dimer composed of γ50-γ57.5, proposing exposure of the C-terminal residues of the γ57.5 chain for fibrin-mediated hemostatic events.
