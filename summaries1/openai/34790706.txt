The text discusses the potential adverse effects of intense and prolonged exercise on cardiac remodeling in athletes, particularly long-distance runners. It mentions the phenomenon of "athlete's heart" and "Phidippides cardiomyopathy," characterized by structural changes in the heart due to high levels of exercise. The study evaluates the role of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) as a possible biomarker for exaggerated atrial remodeling and the development of atrial fibrillation in high-performance athletes. The research involved 36 male long-distance runners and included various tests and assessments to evaluate their performance. Results showed significant structural changes in high-intensity runners compared to low-intensity runners and non-active individuals, with elevated sVCAM-1 levels in high-intensity runners. The study suggests sVCAM-1 levels and peak aerobic capacity as predictors of left atrial volume, indicating a complex relationship between exercise-induced changes, biomarkers, and cardiac remodeling in athletes. Further research is recommended to explore these associations and their implications for atrial fibrillation risk in athletes.
