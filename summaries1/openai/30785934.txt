Clostridium difficile is a gram-positive, anaerobic bacterium that causes antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis in adults. The epidemiology of C. difficile infections is changing, with an increasing incidence in both adults and children. Asymptomatic carriers may serve as a reservoir for transmission, with rates of colonization higher in hospitalized patients and infants. A study focused on C. difficile colonization in preterm neonates, using PCR-ribotyping and MLVA to analyze strains. Results showed an increase in colonization during hospitalization, with certain PCR-ribotypes being more prevalent. The study found that preterm neonates acquired a higher diversity of non-toxigenic strains and toxigenic strains emerged after hospital discharge. Factors like gestational age and birth weight were associated with higher colonization frequency. The study highlighted the importance of environmental exposure in colonization and the potential for hospital transmission of specific strains. The strains identified in preterm neonates were similar to those found in other populations, suggesting possible acquisition from the community environment.
