The text discusses the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the COVID-19 pandemic, with a high number of global infections and deaths. Various vaccines have been developed targeting the Spike glycoprotein, with a focus on the S1 subunit's interaction with the ACE2 receptor. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron, poses challenges for existing vaccines. A study explores the use of an autophagy-inducing peptide (AIP-C5) to enhance immune responses against the Spike protein, showing improved cellular immune responses and protection in mice and hamsters. Adenovirus vectors expressing the Spike protein with or without AIP-C5 were developed, with enhanced immune responses observed in vaccinated animals. The study evaluated vaccine efficacy in animal models, demonstrating reduced morbidity, lower virus titers, and improved lung pathology scores in vaccinated hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2. The importance of neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune responses in protecting against SARS-CoV-2 infection is highlighted, emphasizing the need for new vaccines with broader cross-protection and durability. Immunogenicity studies were conducted in mice and hamsters, evaluating humoral and cell-mediated immune responses through various assays. Challenge studies with SARS-CoV-2 in golden Syrian hamsters assessed vaccine efficacy, with formalin-fixed lung samples analyzed for SARS-CoV-2-induced lesions.
