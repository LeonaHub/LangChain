The text discusses the increasing incidence of thyroid cancer, particularly low-risk papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), and the debate surrounding overdiagnosis and overtreatment. It highlights a study that aimed to identify genetic mutations as predictors of prognosis and suggest appropriate indications for lobectomy (LT) in patients with 1â€“4 cm intrathyroidal PTC. Results showed that TERT promoter mutations were associated with worse outcomes, while BRAF V600E mutations alone did not significantly impact survival. The study also investigated the relationship between the extent of thyroidectomy and outcomes in PTC patients based on TERT promoter mutations, finding that TERT promoter mutations were associated with poor outcomes, especially when coexisting with BRAF V600E mutations. The study suggests that identifying TERT promoter mutations preoperatively may guide surgical decision-making. The research was conducted in Japan and recommended further global, prospective verification.
