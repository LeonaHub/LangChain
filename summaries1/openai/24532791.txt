The text discusses the role of VKORC1 and VKORC1L1 in the vitamin K cycle, blood coagulation, and their inhibition by warfarin. It highlights the differences in membrane topology and reaction mechanisms between the two proteins, emphasizing the need for further research to understand VKORC1L1's physiological function. Experimental procedures involving various materials and techniques were conducted to investigate the activity of VKORC1 and VKORC1L1 proteins, including in vivo and in vitro assays. The text also describes experiments to determine the membrane topology of VKORC1L1 and the importance of conserved loop cysteines for its enzymatic activity. Mutations in these cysteines affect the protein's function, similar to bacterial VKORHs. The study explores the impact of mutations on VKORC1L1, focusing on cysteine residues and their role in disulfide bond formation. It compares VKORC1L1 with VKORC1, highlighting their structural and functional differences, suggesting that VKORC1L1 may support carboxylation rather than vitamin K reduction. The text also addresses discrepancies in warfarin resistance between the two enzymes and discusses the unique structure of VKORC1L1 that allows for an intra-molecular electron transfer pathway for active site regeneration. Overall, the research indicates that VKORC1L1 and VKORC1 have different physiological functions due to their distinct structures and reaction mechanisms.
