Rubella, also known as German measles, was initially considered mild but can cause congenital defects in newborns if contracted by pregnant women. The congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) led to the urgent development of a rubella vaccine in 1970. Symptoms in children and adults include rash, fever, and conjunctivitis, but the virus can lead to miscarriage or CRS in fetuses, especially in the first trimester. Vaccination is crucial, with the WHO recommending 95% coverage for measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination. Italy offers live attenuated vaccines for MMR and MMRV, with surveillance and case investigation essential for monitoring and controlling outbreaks. A study in Italy assessed rubella seroprevalence in pediatric and adolescent populations in Florence, showing high immunity rates among vaccinated individuals. The study aimed to evaluate vaccination campaign success and prevent CRS. The text also discusses the immunization status of women in Italy, emphasizing the impact of vaccination hesitancy and the importance of high vaccination coverage to prevent CRS. Strategies to increase vaccination rates, including targeting adolescents, were suggested. The study concluded with positive results on rubella seropositivity in the province of Florence over 15 years, highlighting the importance of vaccination campaigns
