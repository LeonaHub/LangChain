Acetabular fractures, often caused by high-energy injuries, are commonly treated with open reduction and internal fixation. Surgical approaches like the ilioinguinal, modified Stoppa, and pararectus approaches are used. The pararectus approach, a modification of the Stoppa approach, offers benefits like improved acetabulum exposure and reduced soft tissue damage. A study compared the pararectus and ilioinguinal approaches for acetabular fractures, focusing on techniques, precautions, and outcomes. The pararectus approach involves precise incisions for clear visualization of structures, while the ilioinguinal approach requires a different incision for exposure. Statistical analysis showed the pararectus approach had better results in incision length, exposure time, complications, and functional outcomes. It is preferred for anterior acetabular fractures due to its advantages, but may not be suitable for certain cases. Surgeons using this approach must be knowledgeable about abdominal anatomy to prevent complications. More research with larger sample sizes is needed to assess its long-term efficacy.
