The text discusses the importance of studying in vitro sensory neuron models of pain in preclinical research, emphasizing the practical advantages of using human cell models over animal models. It reviews recent advances in human sensory neuron models, particularly focusing on human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, and compares them to rodent sensory neuron cultures. The text highlights the differences in species physiology and the need for human cell models to validate drug targets before clinical development. It also discusses the challenges and opportunities in studying sensory neurons, including stem cell-derived sensory neurons (SC-SNs) and iPSC technology. The text emphasizes the importance of addressing challenges such as variability in differentiation batches and inter-line variability in stem cell technology to improve research outcomes. Additionally, it mentions the potential of using three-dimensional organoids to mimic complex tissue structures for studying cell-to-cell interactions in pain research. The text concludes that while there is no "gold standard" in vitro human sensory neuron model, leveraging the differences between human dorsal root ganglion (hDRG) neurons and SC-SNs can
