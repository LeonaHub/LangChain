Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a significant mental health consequence of traumatic events, with higher prevalence among women compared to men. Childhood maltreatment, sexual assault, and intimate partner violence are major risk factors for developing PTSD, with racial and ethnic differences influencing the relationship between trauma and PTSD. Comorbid PTSD and other psychiatric disorders, such as depression, are important considerations when studying trauma-related risk factors. Studies have examined predictors of PTSD among different racial and ethnic groups, highlighting the impact of traumatic events like sexual assault and intimate partner violence. The role of comorbidity, particularly Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), in influencing PTSD risk is emphasized, along with the importance of screening and intervention for traumatic experiences and mental health issues.
