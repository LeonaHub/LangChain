Buffaloes are globally important for their heat stress resistance and high birth rates, with populations in countries like Cuba, Brazil, and Argentina. They have lower milk production per hectare compared to cattle due to low stocking rates but can benefit from silvopastoral systems incorporating trees like Leucaena leucocephala and Albizia lebbeck for improved feed quality. A study in Cuba evaluated water buffaloes' selectivity for tree leaves, finding that A. lebbeck and L. leucocephala were the most consumed due to nutritional value and ease of access. The animals showed daily variations in leaf preferences based on nutritional needs rather than hunger. Factors affecting consumption included digestibility and palatability, with A. lebbeck being a significant contributor to protein needs. The study recommends further research on secondary metabolites' impact on feed intake and suggests L. leucocephala and A. lebbeck as suitable tree species for buffalo production systems in the tropics.
