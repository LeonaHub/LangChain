Pulp capping is a crucial dental therapy involving the application of materials to exposed pulp to stimulate dentin formation. Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) is commonly used, but recent research suggests Portland cement could be a cost-effective alternative. A study aimed to develop a new pulp capping material by adding bismuth oxide and calcium hydroxide to Portland cement. Physicochemical properties of two new materials, Port Cal I and Port Cal II, were evaluated. Tests included setting time, pH, and strength properties. Results could lead to an effective new pulp capping material. The study compared different cements for setting time, compressive strength, diametral tensile strength, and push out bond strength. Statistical analysis showed variations among materials, with Portland cement with additives showing promising properties. Overall, adding calcium hydroxide to Portland cement could create a new pulp capping material with acceptable physical and adhesive properties.
