Postnatal depression (PND) is a significant issue affecting new mothers and can impact both the mother and the infant, potentially leading to long-term consequences for the child's development. Research emphasizes the importance of early mother-infant relationships in shaping infant brain development. Interventions targeting mother-infant difficulties following PND are crucial, but existing interventions are limited, highlighting the need for more effective strategies. The text describes a study evaluating the effectiveness of a 9-week PND program followed by the HUGS intervention, focusing on enhancing mother-infant relationships. The HUGS program is a brief, four-session intervention designed to address PND and relationship difficulties, providing a cost-effective and easily accessible solution for many women. The goal is to prevent long-term consequences on infant development and support the mother-infant relationship, ultimately leading to positive social and economic outcomes.
