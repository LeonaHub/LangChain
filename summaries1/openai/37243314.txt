Gout is a chronic disease caused by MSU crystal deposition in joints, leading to painful flares. The NLRP3 inflammasome is central in the inflammation caused by these crystals. Gout flares often occur at night, possibly due to circadian rhythms affecting immune responses. A study investigated how MSU crystals affect the circadian clock in THP-1 macrophages and NLRP3 inflammasome activity. The study used THP-1 cells treated with MSU crystals, analyzing RNA and protein expression through various methods. Results showed MSU crystals altered clock components in macrophages, with time-of-day differences in NLRP3 inflammasome activation. BMAL1 levels influenced this activation, affecting caspase 1 activity and IL-1β secretion. BMAL1 and REV-ERBα were found to regulate inflammatory markers in response to MSU crystals, with BMAL1 repressing pro-inflammatory molecules and showing time-of-day variations in inflammasome activity. The study suggests that low BMAL1 levels may make macrophages more susceptible to inflammasome activation, potentially contributing to conditions like gout flare. The research highlights the circadian clock's influence on immune cell function and inflammation development, indicating its role in various inflammatory conditions.
