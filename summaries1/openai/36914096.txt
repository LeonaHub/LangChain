Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a significant global health concern, with prevention strategies traditionally focusing on short-term risk assessment and treatment. Recent guidelines recommend considering lifetime risk (LTR) for a more comprehensive evaluation, especially for young individuals and women who may be overlooked based on short-term risk assessments. A study conducted in Iran using data from the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS) aimed to estimate LTR for total CVD and assess the impact of risk factors like BMI, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and hypercholesterolemia on CVD risk. The TLGS is a population-based cohort study involving over 12,000 participants aged 20 years and older, with follow-ups conducted regularly to track medical events. The study found that men generally had a higher LTR of developing CVD compared to women, with individual risk factors and higher aggregate risk factor burden associated with increased LTR for CVD and decreased years lived free from CVD. The research emphasizes the importance of long-term risk assessments in motivating lifestyle changes and preventing major risk factors to prolong CVD-free survival and improve quality of life. Maintaining optimal risk factors at a young age was found to delay the onset of CVD, suggesting that early prevention efforts can reduce the burden of premature CVD and enhance long-term cardiovascular health outcomes.
