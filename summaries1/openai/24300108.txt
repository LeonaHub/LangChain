Exposure to ethanol during pregnancy can lead to preventable birth defects and long-term deficits in physical and cognitive development, particularly during the brain growth spurt, which is sensitive to ethanol exposure. Histone and epigenetic alterations, including the involvement of G9a and GLP histone methyltransferases, play a role in ethanol-induced developmental neurotoxicity. A study involving neonatal mice administered with low ethanol doses at P7 showed mild neurodegeneration and changes in histone methylation, DNMT3A, and MeCP2. Pharmacological blockade of G9a protected against ethanol-induced neurodegeneration in mice. The study utilized BIX, an inhibitor of G9a enzymatic activity, to prevent neurodegeneration, as evidenced by immunohistochemistry, Western blot analysis, qPCR, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Inhibiting G9a activity with BIX prevented ethanol-induced neurodegeneration by blocking histone modifications and protein interactions, suggesting potential therapeutic implications for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms and implications of these findings in fetal development and potential therapeutic interventions.
