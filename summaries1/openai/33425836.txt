Healthcare professionals are facing challenges in balancing preventive measures for COVID-19 with the needs of patients with mental disorders, who are at increased risk of infection and mortality. Telepsychiatry, including phone calls and video appointments, has become essential for providing continuous care and support during lockdowns. A blog was launched to support patients with chronic psychiatric disorders during the pandemic, offering information, advice, and a sense of routine. The blog received positive feedback but faced challenges in maintaining patient engagement and receiving online feedback. The clinic's healthcare staff created the blog, which was promoted through various channels but had to be discontinued due to resource constraints. The authors emphasize the importance of telehealth interventions and patient involvement in psychiatric care during public health crises.
