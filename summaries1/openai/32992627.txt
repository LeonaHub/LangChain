The text discusses the integration of quantum dots (QDs) in biomedical applications, focusing on their potential in imaging, therapeutic functions, and biosensors. It highlights the advantages of QDs, such as high quantum yield and resistance to light bleaching, but also addresses concerns regarding their biological toxicity due to toxic heavy metal elements like cadmium and tellurium. The development of eco-friendly QDs, particularly indium phosphide (InP) QDs, is explored as a safer alternative to heavy metal-based QDs. Studies have shown that InP/ZnS QDs have lower toxicity compared to Cd-based QDs, making them promising for biological applications. However, conflicting findings exist regarding the toxicity of InP QDs, with some studies suggesting potential toxicity. The text discusses the importance of studying the toxicity of InP QDs in vivo and in vitro, particularly focusing on their impact on kidney function. It mentions that particle size, surface charge, and surface modification can affect the renal clearance of QDs. The study investigated the renal toxicity of InP/ZnS QDs with different surface modifications in mice, monitoring various parameters such as body weight changes, blood biochemistry, biodistribution, histopathological changes in the kidney, inflammatory responses, oxidative stress markers, and apoptosis pathway markers. The results showed that the QDs with different surface modifications had uniform size and good optical properties. The study found no significant changes in body weight or kidney organ index in mice exposed to the QDs, suggesting potential biosafety of In
