Endometriosis is a common condition in women, often manifesting as ovarian endometriosis. Surgical treatment, like laparoscopic cyst wall stripping, is recommended for larger endometriomas, but recurrence rates are high. Recurrent endometriomas can impact fertility and IVF success, leading to repeated surgeries with risks to ovarian tissue. Post-surgery, hormone-based contraceptives like dienogest are prescribed to prevent recurrence. A study on dienogest's long-term use post-surgery showed low recurrence rates and suggested it as a better option than surgical re-intervention for preventing endometrioma recurrence and improving fertility. Dienogest is preferred over danazol and GnRH agonists due to its tolerable profile and high patient compliance. The study had limitations, and further research is needed to confirm the effectiveness and safety of long-term dienogest therapy in endometriosis patients.
