Platelets play a crucial role in development and hemostasis, with C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (CLEC-2) being a key activatory receptor on platelets. Studies using knockout mouse models and anti-CLEC-2 antibody injections have highlighted the importance of CLEC-2 in separating blood and lymphatic systems and its potential role in thrombus stability. A new study introduced CLEC-2 Y7A knockin mice to investigate the receptor's functions beyond hemITAM signaling and its role in development versus hemostasis. The Y7A mutation in CLEC-2 led to defects in blood-lymph separation in mice, confirming the receptor's critical role in preventing blood filling of lymphatics during development and post-irradiation in adult mice. Various experiments were conducted to analyze the effects of the Y7A mutation on platelet responses and lymphatic defects, showing that the mutation abolishes platelet responses to CLEC-2 agonists and replicates lymphatic abnormalities observed in CLEC-2 deficient mice. The study also examined thrombus stability in Y7A KI mice and found that blocking the CLEC-2 ectodomain destabilized platelet aggregate formation under flow conditions, leading to destabilized hemostasis and thrombosis. Further research is needed to identify the specific blood-borne ligand or counterreceptor of CLEC-2 that mediates its adhesive role in thrombosis and hemostasis.
