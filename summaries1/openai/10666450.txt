Eukaryotic transcription factors are modular proteins with distinct domains for functions like DNA binding and transcription modulation, involving structural motifs like zinc fingers and helix-loop-helix motifs. The gut-enriched Kr√ºppel-like factor (GKLF) is a transcription factor that regulates cell growth and differentiation in epithelial and endothelial tissues by binding to specific DNA sequences. GKLF can act as both a transcriptional activator and a growth suppressor, with specific amino acid residues playing a crucial role in these activities. The study investigates the mechanisms by which GKLF activates transcription and suppresses cell growth, highlighting the interplay between these functions. Experimental procedures involved the generation of various constructs and mutants of GKLF, transfection and reporter assays, as well as protein synthesis and interaction experiments. The results indicate that the transactivating activity of GKLF depends on specific clusters of acidic amino acid residues in its N-terminus, which are crucial for its transactivating effect and intermolecular interactions. The study also discusses the role of p300/CBP co-activators in GKLF's transcriptional regulation and their interaction with GKLF. Additionally, the study demonstrates the importance of acidic residues in GKLF for its growth-suppressing effect, highlighting the significance of the interaction between GKLF and CBP in mediating various biological effects of GKLF.
