The text discusses the importance of polynuclear coordination compounds with octahedral building blocks in solid-state inorganic chemistry, particularly focusing on luminescent characteristics of [M6X8]2– clusters. Recent applications include potential use in tracking cancer cells and bioimaging. It details the synthesis, electronic structure, and optical properties of luminescent [Mo6Cl14]2– clusters and their non-luminescent [Mo6Cl14]2––TNT complex. The study incorporates relativistic effects and computational methods to analyze the cluster's fluorescence properties and its sensitivity to nitroaromatic compounds, particularly TNT. The Stern-Volmer equation is used to describe the quenching of the cluster's fluorescence by TNT, indicating efficient quenching and potential for sensing TNT at low concentrations. Theoretical calculations suggest strong interaction between TNT and the cluster, leading to luminescence deactivation. The study concludes that the molybdenum cluster shows promise as a sensor for detecting nitroaromatic explosives, but further testing in real samples with other substances is necessary.
