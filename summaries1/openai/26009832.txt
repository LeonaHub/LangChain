The text discusses the HPTN 052 study, which focused on HIV-1 serodiscordant couples and the impact of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on preventing HIV transmission. Adherence to medication was found to be crucial for effectiveness, with factors like low social support, depression, substance use, and socio-economic issues affecting adherence. The study used various methods to measure adherence, including questionnaires, pill counts, and psychosocial assessments. Adherence counseling was provided, and specific ART regimens were prescribed. The study found that mental health was consistently associated with adherence, while other factors like substance use and social support did not have the same impact. The results emphasize the importance of evidence-based counseling, clear communication, and feedback on viral suppression to optimize adherence to ART for both treatment and prevention of HIV.
