The text discusses the folding of apomyoglobin (apoMb) and its structural characteristics compared to holomyoglobin (holoMb). ApoMb is found to have a more dynamic structure with a slightly decreased helix content and protection from hydrogen exchange. Acid-induced unfolding of apoMb involves at least one equilibrium intermediate form (I) at pH 4.2, which is structurally compact with helical content. Studies have been conducted to assess the tertiary interactions and stability of the I form, with some suggesting it resembles a molten globule intermediate. Different types of substitutions at buried residue Met-131 have been studied to determine their effects on the stability of the N and I forms of apoMb. The presence of specific native packing interactions in the I form has been debated, with some studies focusing on underpacking substitutions. The effects of overpacking substitutions at position 131 are examined to determine if specific side-chain packing interactions are retained in the I form. The methods used for mutagenesis, protein expression, and purification are also described. The text describes the methods used for protein purification and denaturation studies of myoglobin variants M131G and M131Q. The variants were grown in 10-ml cultures, purified using ion-exchange columns, and stored at -80Â°C. Acid-induced and urea-induced denaturation studies were conducted using CD spectroscopy and fluorescence monitoring. The data analysis involved
