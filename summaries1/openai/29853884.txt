Adiponectin, traditionally seen as an energy storage organ, was discovered in the late 1980s to have endocrine functions, impacting various reproductive tissues. It circulates in different forms and concentrations, with levels influenced by factors like sex and age. Adiponectin plays a role in regulating reproductive functions by affecting hormone release, gene expression, and signaling pathways in tissues like the hypothalamus, pituitary, ovaries, and uterus. It influences processes such as food intake, energy expenditure, and gonadal hormone secretion. Adiponectin's effects on the reproductive system are mediated by receptors like AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, with a third receptor, T-cadherin, also noted. The hormone influences ovarian functions, including preovulatory changes, steroidogenesis, and oocyte maturation, with implications for disorders like polycystic ovary syndrome. Adiponectin's presence in reproductive tissues suggests its direct involvement in gonadal functions and overall reproductive regulation. It also impacts processes in the reproductive
