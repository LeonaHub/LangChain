ADHD is a common neurodevelopmental disorder in children, characterized by inattention and impairments in attention and inhibition control. Research has shown a link between eye movements and attention deficits in children with ADHD. A study investigated the effects of Quiet Eye (QE) training, which focuses on optimizing eye fixations during tasks, on attention deficits in children with ADHD. The randomized controlled trial involved 72 children aged 9-12, with one group receiving QE training and the other serving as a control. The study found that QE training could potentially improve attention deficits in children with ADHD. The training involved targeting tasks and watching videos of skilled models performing actions. Results showed improvements in focused attention and performance in the QE training group, with increased accuracy and reduced errors. However, QE training did not affect tonic or phasic attention. The study highlighted the need for further research on non-pharmacological therapies for ADHD.
