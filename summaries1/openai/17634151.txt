Comparative genome sequencing reveals that closely related organisms have similar total gene numbers but differ in specific genes due to gains and losses during evolution. Gene duplication and loss shape genomes, with recent focus on gene loss. Challenges in studying gene gain and loss include biases in data analysis, impacting inferences about vertebrate genome evolution. Errors in gene tree reconstruction can lead to biases in tree reconciliation, affecting the placement of duplications and losses. Biases in methods aiming to minimize gains and losses in gene trees can impact evolutionary studies. The text suggests iterative methods to address biases and emphasizes the importance of accurate gene tree inference methods. Biases in tree reconciliation methods can affect studies on gene gain and loss in vertebrate genomes, particularly in cases of incomplete lineage sorting. The text highlights the need for caution in interpreting results and proposes improvements in methods to address biases. Further research using simulation results, improved gene trees, and more data will be necessary to accurately understand vertebrate genome evolution.
