The Abyssinian pea is a distinct taxon cultivated in Ethiopia and Yemen, with uncertain origins and unique characteristics compared to domesticated peas. Studies show reduced fertility in crosses with other pea species, suggesting barriers to hybridization. Research comparing DNA sequences of different pea subspecies aims to determine the Abyssinian pea's evolutionary history, indicating a hybrid origin from P. s. ssp. sativum and P. s. ssp. elatius. The genetic diversity and relationships among different subspecies of Pisum sativum are analyzed, with a focus on the limited genetic diversity in the Abyssinian pea impacting its potential for adaptation and improvement. The text explores taxonomic considerations within the Pisum genus and discusses the genetic evidence suggesting a genetic bottleneck in the Abyssinian pea's evolution. It also raises questions about independent domestication events and the loss of natural adaptations in crops. The study concludes by suggesting the Abyssinian pea may represent an independent domestication event, potentially evolving traits like indehiscent pods independently in its lineage.
