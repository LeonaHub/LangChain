The text discusses the increasing trend of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) procedures in the United States, with projections indicating a significant rise in cases by 2050. Factors contributing to this trend include improving economics, obesity, longer life expectancy, and higher rates of joint implants in younger patients. Vascular complications, particularly venous thromboembolism (VTE), post-TKA are a known risk impacting patient mortality and healthcare costs. Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a common condition affecting TKA outcomes, with a recent study analyzing post-TKA outcomes in patients with varying complexities of CVI. The study found that CVI status did not significantly impact post-operative complication rates, but complex CVI was associated with a higher risk of complications compared to simple CVI. Private insurance status, more recent surgery years, and increased age were associated with decreased risks of complications, while black race and smoking were associated with increased risks. The study suggests the importance of stratifying CVI severity for assessing risks in TKA patients and highlights the need for further research on CVI's impact on TKA outcomes.
