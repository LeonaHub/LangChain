The text discusses the significance of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) in diagnosing and staging prostate cancer, particularly in assessing extraprostatic extension (EPE). It outlines a study that aimed to develop a comprehensive scoring system, called mEPE-score, to predict EPE accurately. The study followed ISUP recommendations and involved imaging analysis by radiologists at two sites. The mEPE-score assigns scores based on specific imaging features, showing good diagnostic performance and outperforming other scoring systems. Internal and external validation studies demonstrated the reliability of the mEPE-score in predicting EPE. The text emphasizes the importance of using a scoring system for consistent and reliable assessment of EPE in prostate cancer evaluation using mpMRI.
