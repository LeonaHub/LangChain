The text discusses the role of fibrinopeptide B release and the exposure of the NH2-terminus of the β-chain in fibrin clot formation by thrombin. It presents a study on a new β-chain variant in congenitally abnormal fibrinogen Ise, characterized by slow fibrinopeptide B release and a single amino acid substitution. The study involved coagulation studies, purification of fibrinogen, and analyses of fibrinopeptides. A case report of a 50-year-old man with hypofibrinogenemia is included, along with findings from coagulation studies on him and his family. The study also analyzed a propositus with abnormal fibrinogen, showing impaired fibrin aggregation and slower conversion of Bβ-chains to β-chains compared to normal controls. High thrombin concentrations led to the conversion of Bβ-chains to β-chains, with degraded α-chains observed. The text discusses the HPLC analysis of abnormal peaks in the Bβ-chains due to a point mutation, resulting in delayed fibrinopeptide B release and prolonged thrombin time in fibrinogen Ise. It highlights the importance of the NH2-terminus of the β-chain in fibrin clot formation and the unique characteristics of fibrinogen Detroit and fibrinogen Ise in abnormal polymerization and clot formation. Challenges in determining the effects of these variants on fibrin monomer polymerization and structure are mentioned, emphasizing the need for high thrombin concentrations in analyzing abnormal fibrinogens with defective fibrinopeptide release.
