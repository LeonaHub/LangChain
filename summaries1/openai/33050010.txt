Bladder cancer, particularly muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), is a significant health concern in Europe with high mortality rates. Current treatment strategies involve radical cystectomy, but efforts are being made to improve outcomes through new therapeutic approaches and predictive models. Molecular tissue biomarkers like survivin, CD68, CLEVER-1, and ERBB2 are being studied for their potential to stratify risk groups and guide treatment decisions. The research aims to assess the prognostic role of these markers in MIBC patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy using IHC or PCR, along with clinical parameters. The study included 50 MIBC patients and analyzed protein and mRNA markers in TURB biopsies, revealing associations between markers like survivin, KRT20, ERBB2, BIRC5, and CD68. The text discusses the associations between macrophage infiltration, tumor subtypes, and various molecular markers in bladder cancer, highlighting their impact on disease-specific survival and progression-free survival. The study also examines the prognostic value of survivin, BIRC5, KRT20, and ERBB2 in predicting outcomes in bladder cancer patients, particularly in response to chemotherapy. The study suggests that a combination of immunohistochemical and molecular methods could help
