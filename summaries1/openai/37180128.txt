The text discusses the concept of "double diabetes" in children, where individuals with type 1 diabetes also exhibit features of type 2 diabetes. It emphasizes the importance of measuring C-peptide levels to estimate residual insulin secretion in type 1 diabetes patients and the positive impact of even low levels of C-peptide on metabolic control. The text explores the relationship between obesity, C-peptide levels, and beta-cell function in type 1 diabetes individuals, suggesting that obesity may trigger the destruction of pancreatic islets through pro-inflammatory cytokines. Studies have shown correlations between BMI and levels of inflammatory cytokines, as well as the impact of obesity on insulin resistance and beta-cell destruction. The text also discusses therapeutic interventions targeting the immune system to preserve beta-cell function in type 1 diabetes patients, highlighting specific therapies like teplizumab, abatacept, and golimumab. Further research is emphasized to better understand the relationship between factors such as BMI, inflammation, and C-peptide levels in individuals with type 1 diabetes.
