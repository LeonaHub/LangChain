Medulloblastoma is a malignant pediatric brain tumor with distinct molecular subgroups, each having different genetic features and clinical outcomes. Group 3 medulloblastomas have the worst prognosis and are resistant to conventional therapies, prompting the search for novel treatments. The Connectivity Map (C-MAP) database was utilized to identify potential small molecule inhibitors for Group 3 medulloblastomas based on gene expression signatures. Alsterpaullone (ALP), a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, was identified as a promising therapeutic agent for Group 3 tumors. Validation experiments confirmed ALP's efficacy in treating Group 3 medulloblastoma cell lines and xenografts by reversing gene signatures and downregulating cell cycle-related genes. The study also identified other potential drugs for different medulloblastoma subgroups, emphasizing the importance of subgroup-specific treatments for better outcomes. Additionally, the text discusses the effects of various compounds on medulloblastoma cells, highlighting ALP's ability to induce apoptosis, inhibit the AKT pathway, and down-regulate cell cycle-related genes. The study showcases the potential of ALP and other compounds in treating medulloblastoma, with ALP emerging as a promising candidate for further research. The research demonstrates the use of chemical genomics to identify therapeutic agents for medulloblastoma subgroups, particularly emphasizing ALP's potential as a targeted therapy for Group 3 medulloblastomas. Future studies are recommended to delve deeper into CDK regulation in Group 3
