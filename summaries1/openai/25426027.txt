Chronic cranial windows have been instrumental in advancing in vivo optical imaging studies in small animals like mice, allowing for long-term high-resolution imaging in various brain regions. A new method involving a silicone plug in the glass window cover slip has been developed to simplify surgeries and enable repeated injections, functional imaging, and electrical recordings over several weeks. The process involves mixing silicone components, applying them to the window hole edges, and ensuring a specific thickness for the silicone plug. The surgical procedure includes anesthetizing the mice, preparing the skull, and attaching the glass window with dental acrylic. The text also discusses the use of different types of silicone materials for creating access ports in chronic cranial window surgeries on mice, with Sylgard 184 being preferred for its transparency and rigidity. The method allows for chronic functional imaging after repeated dye injections to study cellular activity in the brain, as well as whole-cell patch clamp recordings on labeled neurons. The biocompatible silicone plug incorporated into the chronic cranial window enables repeated access to the brain for cellular manipulations using micropipettes or electrodes, maintaining imaging quality and providing stable access for weeks to months. This device simplifies experiments, reduces the number of animals needed for research, and enables new experiments that were previously not possible due to limited brain access.
