Patient and Family Advisory Councils (PFACs) are groups of patients, family members, and caregivers that provide advice in healthcare settings, with increasing prevalence in the United States due to regulatory requirements. A study conducted at Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics aimed to understand non-PFAC member patients' expectations regarding PFACs. The study involved five diverse focus groups, analyzing data through grounded theory techniques. Participants expressed the importance of communication, representation, and diversity within PFACs. The study emphasized the roles, responsibilities, and impact of PFACs on patient satisfaction and trust in healthcare systems, highlighting the need for transparency and effectiveness evaluation. Participants showed elements of different types of political representation in their views on PFACs, emphasizing the importance of understanding legitimate representation in healthcare governance. The study suggests recommendations for improving PFAC structures and researching their impact on healthcare delivery and decision-making processes.
