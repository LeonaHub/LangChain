The text discusses a study that evaluated the expression of various proteins in inflammatory periradicular lesions (IPLs) such as periapical granulomas (PGs) and periapical cysts (PCs). The study involved histological analyses and immunohistochemical reactions on specimens to assess factors influencing the progression from PGs to PCs. The findings indicated differences in the expression of growth factors and anti-apoptotic proteins between PGs and PCs, with EGF and KGF being more prevalent in PCs. The study also observed associations between inflammatory infiltrates, Ki-67 expression, and epithelial cell proliferation in cystic lesions. Overall, the research suggests that EGF, KGF, and inflammatory factors play a role in the development of IPLs.
