Rabies is a deadly viral infection that primarily affects dogs and poses a significant threat to human health, especially in Africa. The World Health Organization aims to eliminate rabies deaths by 2030, but challenges such as lack of dog vaccination and delays in treatment hinder progress. A study in Ghana analyzed data from 1030 clients to understand patterns of animal bites, patient characteristics, and factors contributing to noncompliance with rabies treatment schedules. Results showed that dog bites were common, with most occurring at home, and males were more likely to delay treatment initiation. Efforts to vaccinate dogs and educate the public on rabies prevention are crucial. Children are at higher risk of bites due to their behavior, emphasizing the need for public health interventions to prevent rabies infections. The study highlights the importance of prompt treatment to prevent rabies and calls for counseling patients on prophylaxis and educating children on avoiding animal bites.
