It highlights predictors of PTSD, prevalence rates in different populations, and the need for better understanding in low-income countries like Ethiopia. A systematic review and meta-analysis in Ethiopia found a 39.28% prevalence of PTSD among trauma survivors, with factors like poor social support and being female associated with higher risk. The study identified previous mental illness and witnessing traumatic events as predictors of PTSD. The impact of social interactions, cultural factors, and the importance of social support in preventing PTSD are also discussed. The study emphasizes the high prevalence of PTSD in Ethiopia and the need for immediate intervention, particularly for vulnerable groups.
