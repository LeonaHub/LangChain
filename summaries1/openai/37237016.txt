The text discusses the magneto-strain effect in 2D magnetic materials, particularly focusing on CrGeTe3, a 2D ferromagnetic van der Waals material with potential applications in spintronics, straintronics, sensors, actuators, and transducers. The magneto-strain effect in CrGeTe3 is associated with an isostructural transition across the Curie temperature, leading to volume collapse and first-order nature. The electronic structure of CrGeTe3 is affected by lattice contractions, resulting in band shifts, broadening, and twinned bands in the ferromagnetic phase. The interplay between electron-electron correlation and spin-orbit coupling contributes to the 2D ferromagnetism, out-of-plane spin polarization, and in-plane magnetocrystalline anisotropy in CrGeTe3. X-ray diffraction analysis confirms crystal orientation along the c-axis in CrGeTe3 single crystals. The study involves temperature-dependent magnetization measurements, revealing a phase transition from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic behavior. The text also discusses the electronic structure of CrGeTe3, highlighting the contributions of different atomic states to the valence band. The use of GGA + U calculations to study Coulomb correlation effects in the Cr 3d orbital is mentioned, with comparisons to experimental data. The text also delves into changes in core-level spectra of Cr, Te, and Ge elements, indicating variations in spectral weight, spin-orbit splitting, and hybridization in the valence states. Overall
