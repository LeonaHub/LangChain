Neutrophils are essential immune cells that help defend the body against infections, with their timely removal through apoptosis being crucial for resolving inflammation. Factors like bacterial phagocytosis and cytokines can influence neutrophil apoptosis, which may be altered in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and undergoing hemodialysis (HD). A study in Egypt assessed neutrophil apoptosis in CKD and HD patients, finding accelerated apoptosis and decreased viability in these groups compared to healthy controls. Uremia and other factors contribute to immune abnormalities in CKD and HD patients, leading to increased inflammation and neutrophil dysfunction. The study also observed that granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) delayed neutrophil apoptosis and increased cell viability in both patient groups, potentially reducing the risk of infections. Further research is needed to fully understand the therapeutic potential of GM-CSF in improving immune function in individuals with kidney diseases.
