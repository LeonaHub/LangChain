The text discusses the impact of modern technology in spine surgery, emphasizing the importance of evaluating the value of medical technologies based on their ability to improve patient care while minimizing costs. It addresses the overutilization of advanced imaging and specialist referrals in spine care, advocating for evidence-based practices to avoid unnecessary expenses and procedures. The text suggests a shift towards value-based care in spine surgery to optimize patient outcomes and healthcare spending. It also examines the appropriateness of using advanced imaging, such as MRI, for low back pain and cervical spine clearance, highlighting the need for clear guidelines to avoid unnecessary costs. The effectiveness and cost implications of intraoperative neuromonitoring, spinal orthoses, biologics, and robotic assistance in spine surgery are also discussed, with a focus on the need for unbiased cost analysis to determine their true cost-effectiveness. Additionally, the text stresses the importance of evaluating the necessity of perioperative testing and the impact of overuse of medical commodities on the overall value of care in spine surgery.
