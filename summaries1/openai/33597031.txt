The text discusses a study on the use of endoscopic nasopharyngectomy as a surgical approach for local, recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (rNPC) as an alternative to re-irradiation. The study aimed to provide updated 5-year outcomes following this procedure in North America. The research methodology involved obtaining approval from the Stanford University Institutional Review Board, retrospective review of adult patients with rNPC who underwent salvage endoscopic nasopharyngectomy at Stanford Medical Center, and tracking disease recurrence after the surgery. The study reports on the 5-year disease-free rate, overall survival rate, and complications experienced by patients, categorizing complications as minor or major. Results showed that out of 25 patients, only 13 were eligible for a 5-year follow-up, with a 5-year local control rate of 61.5% and a disease-free rate of 53.9%. The study compared the effectiveness of endoscopic nasopharyngectomy versus IMRT in treating NPC, suggesting that appropriately selected patients with rT1-T2 staged rNPC should consider endoscopic surgical dissection over reirradiation. The study proposed a revised TNM staging system based on surgical resectability to better guide treatment decisions and highlighted the importance of histological subtypes and EBV positivity in predicting outcomes. Close endoscopic surveillance following salvage endoscopic nasopharyngectomy was shown to be effective in achieving local and regional control in recurrent cases. Repeat surgeries were offered for safe and possible cases, with 75% achieving negative margins, and despite high rates of negative margins and adjuvant therapies, all patients experienced disease progression and mortality. Close surveillance and prompt management with surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy can lead to satisfactory 5-year local control and overall survival rates.
