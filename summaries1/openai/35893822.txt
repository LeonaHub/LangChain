The text discusses the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the importance of developing mucosal vaccines to induce local immune responses against the virus. It explores the interaction of the virus with ACE-2 receptors in the respiratory tract, triggering inflammatory responses and immune cell recruitment. The text emphasizes the need for mucosal vaccines to prevent viral replication and shedding in the airways. It also delves into the role of cytokines like BAFF and APRIL, as well as chemokines like CXCL13, CCL19, and CCL21, in enhancing mucosal immunity against SARS-CoV-2. The text highlights the formation of iBALT in response to infection, which supports the local immune response and enhances antibody production. Studies have shown the potential of BAFF and APRIL in inducing B cell responses and antibody production, with implications for respiratory viral infections like COVID-19. Elevated levels of chemokines like CXCL13 and CCL19 have been associated with severe COVID-19 cases, suggesting their potential as predictive markers for disease severity. The text also discusses the importance of mucosal immunity in protecting against SARS-CoV-2 and the efficacy of intranasal vaccines in inducing specific immune responses. Research on mucosal vaccines, including those utilizing BAFF, APRIL, and iBALT, shows promise in enhancing local immune responses against SARS-CoV-2.
