Protein homeostasis is essential for cell function and is linked to diseases when disrupted. Protein ubiquitination, involving the attachment of ubiquitin molecules to proteins, is a key mechanism for regulating protein levels and cellular processes. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), such as USP21, regulate this process by removing ubiquitin chains. A new inhibitor, BAY-805, was developed for USP21, showing high potency and selectivity. Compound 21, an optimized derivative, demonstrated strong inhibitory activity against USP21 in biochemical and cellular assays, with high selectivity and low off-target effects. It also enhanced the NF-ÎºB pathway. The compound is considered a valuable tool for studying USP21's biological pathways and potential as a cancer target. Further investigations on compound 21's antiproliferative effects in various cell lines confirmed its selectivity and potency against USP21. The compound's favorable pharmacological profile makes it a promising candidate for anticancer drug development and cellular studies on USP21.
