Ependymoma (EPN) is a malignant brain tumor that primarily affects children, with the most common location being in the posterior fossa. Prognosis for EPN is influenced by factors such as age, tumor location, and genetic alterations. Current treatment involves surgical removal followed by radiation therapy, but EPN often shows resistance to conventional therapies. Amblyomin-X, a protein derived from tick salivary glands, has shown antitumor properties in various cancer cell lines. A study aimed to evaluate the antitumor activity of Amblyomin-X in pediatric EPN by establishing EPN cell cultures and conducting in vitro and in vivo experiments. Results showed that Amblyomin-X induced cytotoxicity in EPN cells, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic option for EPN treatment. The study found significant cytotoxic effects on EPN cells treated with Amblyomin-X, inducing apoptosis and altering cell ultrastructure. In contrast, normal cells did not show cytotoxic effects with Amblyomin-X treatment. The research also involved internalizing nanoparticles into EPN cells, observing tumor growth progression, and analyzing the effects of Amblyomin-X treatment on tumor regression. Results showed a significant decrease in tumor mass after treatment with Amblyomin-X, with histological and imaging analyses confirming its efficacy in inducing tumor regression without affecting normal cells. Preclinical evidence suggested that Amblyomin-X may induce cell death in tumor cells through mechanisms involving aggresomes and the autophagy pathway. In vivo studies using xenograft models showed significant tumor regression after treatment with Amblyomin-X, indicating its potential as an anti-EPN drug candidate. The study highlighted the selective potential of Amblyomin-X
