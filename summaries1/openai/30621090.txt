The text discusses the importance of heterosis in agricultural production and the molecular basis of heterosis, focusing on gene expression analysis in chicken embryos from different genetic backgrounds. The study used RNA sequencing data to analyze gene expression patterns, particularly focusing on non-additive expression patterns such as dominance, over-dominance, and under-dominance. The results showed differences in gene expression between different chicken lines, with higher numbers of differentially expressed genes in brain and liver tissues. The study identified potential differences in metabolic pathways and antimicrobial peptide expression between crossbred chickens and parental lines, suggesting the role of regulatory mechanisms in driving heterosis. Further research on gene expression in different tissues and developmental stages is recommended to fully understand the molecular mechanisms underlying heterosis in chickens.
