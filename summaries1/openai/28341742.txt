The text discusses the variability in infectivity of enveloped viruses, focusing on the role of endosomal pH, cell-specific factors, and interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) in viral fusion. It presents experiments on avian sarcoma and leukosis virus (ASLV) entry and fusion kinetics, highlighting differences in fusion rates between cell types. The study examines the impact of temperature and endosomal pH on ASLV fusion, showing delayed fusion in A549 cells due to insufficient acidification. The inhibitory effect of IFITM3 on ASLV fusion is also discussed, with findings suggesting its role in promoting early acidification of virus-carrying compartments. The text details experimental procedures, including live cell imaging, virus-cell fusion assays, and endosomal pH measurements using transferrin uptake experiments. Methodologies for ratiometric measurements and immunofluorescence assays in IFITM3-expressing cells are outlined, along with statistical analysis techniques used in the study.
