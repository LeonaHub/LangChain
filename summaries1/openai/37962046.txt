Neurotensin (NTS/NT) is a neuropeptide that acts through neurotensin receptors (NTSRs), with NTSR2 being a G-protein-coupled receptor involved in various physiological functions. NTSR2 has been linked to psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and dopamine-related disorders, suggesting therapeutic potential. It plays roles in regulating neurotransmitter release, dopamine receptors, and glutamate in the brain, affecting processes like amphetamine sensitization, fear regulation, addiction, and anxiety. NTSR2 is also implicated in brain development, neuronal excitability, and neuroinflammation. In terms of analgesia, NTSR2 is expressed in brain regions associated with pain regulation and has been targeted for the development of analgesic treatments. Additionally, NTSR2 is found in various tumors, including glioma, leukemia, neuroendocrine tumors, and gastric cancer, where it plays roles in cell survival, apoptosis, and cell growth. Further
