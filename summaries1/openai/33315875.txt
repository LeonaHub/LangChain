Helminths, such as the Schistosoma haematobium parasite, infect over a billion people globally, causing diseases like schistosomiasis, particularly prevalent in regions with poor sanitation. The interaction between the parasite and host involves manipulation of the host's metabolism for parasite survival, impacting immune responses and metabolic functions. While schistosome infections have detrimental effects, some studies suggest they may reduce the occurrence and severity of conditions like metabolic syndrome. Research aims to understand the molecular pathways involved in disease progression and metabolic changes caused by schistosome infections, especially in infants and young children. A study characterizes the host metabolite profiles of Zimbabwean preschool-aged children before and after their first S. haematobium infection, using various statistical methods to analyze metabolite profiles in different groups based on age, sex, and infection status. Results show differences in metabolite profiles based on sex and infection status, with changes in metabolite concentrations in response to infection intensity. Metabolite levels increased with infection intensity and returned to pre-infection levels after treatment with praziquantel, affecting energy and purine metabolism pathways. The study highlights the importance of understanding host-parasite interactions through metabolomic studies and suggests that metabolic disturbances are associated with schistosome infection, potentially contributing to parasite-related morbidity in children. Further research is needed to develop interventions for helminth infections in children.
