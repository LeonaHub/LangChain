Pecans are a significant crop in the southeastern United States, with Georgia being a leading producer. Pecan scab, caused by the fungus Venturia effusa, is a major concern for growers due to its impact on yield. The fungus has shown resistance to demethylation-inhibiting (DMI) fungicides, commonly used for control, attributed to genetic changes in the pathogen's CYP51 gene. Cross-resistance among different DMIs has been observed, posing a challenge for disease management. A study investigated the resistance of V. effusa to tebuconazole, finding variability in sensitivity among isolates, with mutations in the CYP51A and CYP51B genes leading to resistance. The study suggests further research on resistance mechanisms and the importance of understanding fungicide sensitivity for effective management. Difenoconazole and mefentrifluconazole were effective against V. effusa, while tebuconazole showed resistance due to mutations in the CYP51 genes. The study aims to develop rapid detection methods for tracking resistance traits and optimize management strategies to improve scab control efficacy. Further research is needed on ABC transporters and efflux transporters as potential sources of resistance. Gel electrophoresis, Sanger sequencing, and gene expression analysis were used to investigate resistance mechanisms. The study highlights the importance of developing effective resistance management programs and using combination products with multiple active ingredients to delay resistance development.
