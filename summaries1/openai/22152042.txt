The text discusses the biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (SNPs) using Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells and cell-free extracts. The study compares in vivo and in vitro biosynthesis processes, highlighting the role of active biomolecules in the synthesis of SNPs. Various proteins associated with SNPs biosynthesis are identified, including ATPase, carbonic anhydrase, and histone (H4). The study suggests that the presence of specific proteins influences the size and shape of the synthesized nanoparticles. The methods involved in the preparation of C. reinhardtii cell-free extract for nanoparticle biosynthesis and the characterization of SNPs using various techniques such as electron microscopy, spectroscopy, and elemental analysis are described. The study also includes protein depletion experiments to investigate the role of various proteins in the biosynthesis of SNPs. The potential applications of biologically synthesized SNPs and the need for controlled synthesis for commercial production are emphasized.
