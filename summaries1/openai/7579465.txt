Neutrophils are crucial phagocytes in the body's defense system, responding to signals through tyrosine phosphorylation pathways involving kinases and phosphatases. The study investigates lyn activation in human neutrophils by different agonists, showing lyn as a common step in neutrophil response. Various substances and techniques were used to study in vitro tyrosine kinase activity, revealing specific patterns of phosphorylation induced by different factors. Lyn demonstrated increased autophosphorylation when stimulated by chemotactic factors or agonists like zymosan and bacteria. The study confirms lyn's role in signal transduction mechanisms in neutrophils and its association with physiological responses like phospholipase D and NADPH oxidase activation. Lyn activation was confirmed through multiple experimental protocols, indicating its importance in cytokine receptor pathways and phagocytosis. Further research is needed to understand the complete pattern of tyrosine kinase activation by different neutrophil agonists and the involvement of other kinases and signaling pathways in specific cellular responses.
