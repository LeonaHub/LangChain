Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a common and deadly urological tumor with unclear causes, though factors like smoking, hypertension, and genetics may elevate risk. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can serve as genetic markers for cancer development. A study examined two common SNPs of the MAGE-A11 gene in relation to RCC risk and survival, involving 1027 cases and 1094 controls. The research aimed to assess the impact of these SNPs on RCC and survival, utilizing statistical methods like t-tests, chi-square tests, logistic regression, and survival analysis. The study discovered significant associations between certain SNPs and RCC risk, with specific genotypes increasing the likelihood of RCC development. Additionally, correlations were identified between these SNPs and demographic and clinical factors like age, body mass index, smoking, and hypertension. The study also explored the effects of these SNPs on RCC survival, with certain genotypes linked to poorer prognosis. Specifically, MAGE-A11 rs6641352 and rs6540341 were found to be associated with an increased risk of RCC, with rs6641352 also impacting RCC survival. The study suggests that rs6641352 may be an independent prognostic factor for RCC, but further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms.
