The text discusses the increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in COVID-19 patients, particularly in the ICU setting. It highlights conflicting prevalence rates of VTE in different healthcare settings and the importance of understanding the association between COVID-19 and VTE for emergency physicians. A retrospective observational study in Sweden found no significant difference in VTE incidence among COVID-19 patients compared to previous years, suggesting that COVID-19 status alone may not dictate VTE workup in the emergency department. The study included logistic regression, prevalence comparisons, and sensitivity analysis, and ethical considerations were followed. Overall, the findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection did not increase the risk of VTE in the studied cohort of patients, except for those in the ICU.
