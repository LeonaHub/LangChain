The text discusses the global issue of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and its impact on public health, emphasizing the challenges posed by multidrug-resistant bacteria, particularly ESKAPE pathogens. It highlights the importance of antibiotic stewardship programs in preserving antibiotic effectiveness. The study evaluates the evolution of AMR in a Romanian infectious diseases hospital from 2016 to 2020, focusing on ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae strains and MRSA. It presents data on resistance rates, trends, and antibiotic resistance profiles of various bacteria, noting increasing resistance rates, especially in 2020. The text also addresses challenges in microbiological diagnosis and the need for improved surveillance and diagnostic methods to combat AMR, recommending harmonization with European standards and updating local antibiotic protocols.
