Iron-based nanoparticles, particularly iron oxide nanoparticles coated with l-lysine, have unique properties and are widely used in various fields such as medicine and environmental science. Studies have shown that these nanoparticles have concentration-dependent effects on living cells, impacting cell growth, viability, and biofilm formation. In aquatic environments, iron nanoparticles can influence the growth and metabolic states of microorganisms like microalgae, affecting biofilm formation. The text describes a study where lysine-coated iron oxide nanoparticles were synthesized and characterized using various techniques. The interaction of these nanoparticles with microalgal cells was studied, showing toxic effects at higher concentrations but with the cells eventually adapting and tolerating the nanoparticles. The study found that lysine-coated iron oxide nanoparticles can promote biofilm formation at low concentrations while inhibiting it at higher concentrations. The research suggests that these nanoparticles could impact microalgal biofilm formation in industrial processes, with the importance of considering concentration and exposure time.
