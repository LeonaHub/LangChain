The text discusses the role of electrophile signaling in the central nervous system (CNS), focusing on endogenous reactive electrophilic metabolites and their impact on neurodegenerative diseases. It highlights the generation of lipid-derived electrophiles (LDEs) in neuronal tissues due to reactive oxygen species and redox-active metals, as well as the low expression of detoxification enzymes in the brain leading to LDE accumulation. Various endogenous electrophilic metabolites are implicated in CNS signaling, with methods like activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) and targetable reactive electrophiles and oxidants (T-REX) used to study LDEs and their protein targets. The text also explores the role of LDE signaling in regulating Keap1/Nrf2/Antioxidant Response (AR) signaling in diseases like Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and discusses the potential therapeutic benefits of targeting the Nrf2/AR pathway. It delves into the mechanism of action of Dimethyl Fumarate
