Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are converted by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes into oxylipin metabolites, which are important lipid mediators with various biological functions. Arachidonic acid (ARA) is metabolized into hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) by CYP enzymes, with different functions. Various CYP isoforms are involved in metabolizing PUFAs like eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The synthesis of ω-hydroxy PUFAs is challenging but important for expanding metabolite analysis. Practical chemical syntheses of these compounds have been achieved using a convergent synthetic approach. The text discusses the synthesis of ω-hydroxy PUFAs and their effects on TRPV1 channels, which are involved in pain sensation. In vivo and in vitro studies showed that 20-HETE induced pain in rats, while 20-HEPE and 22-HDoHE did not affect nociceptive thresholds. The study suggests that ω-3 hydroxy metabolites derived from EPA and DHA may have beneficial effects on pain compared to 20-HETE. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms of action of these ω-hydroxy PUFAs in pain biology and their potential therapeutic properties.
