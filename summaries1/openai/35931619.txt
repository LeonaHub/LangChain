The text discusses the importance of monitoring wound healing and the use of measurement instruments to assess wound progression and quality of life. It outlines the phases of wound healing, factors influencing the process, and introduces measurement instruments like the RESVECH 2.0 tool. A study validated a Portuguese version of the RESVECH 2.0 tool through cultural adaptation, reliability, and validity tests. The study involved experts in wound care conducting cognitive debriefings and targeted patients with chronic wounds in various hospital departments. Data collection included collaboration with nurses and authorization from hospital authorities. Statistical analyses using SPSS were conducted on a sample of 281 patients with various characteristics. The study found high agreement between raters, acceptable internal consistency, and identified six main factors in the data. The RESVECH 2.0 scale showed good validity in assessing chronic wounds and correlated with other measurement tools. The text emphasizes the impact of wound classification and health status on quality of life, highlighting the importance of considering infection parameters and wound typology in evaluation. Living with chronic wounds can lead to social exclusion and decreased quality of life, making the RESVECH 2.0 scale a valuable tool for research and clinical practice. Further research is recommended to assess its psychometric properties in different settings.
