Lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the SLC7A7 gene, leading to dysfunction of the y + LAT‐1 protein. Patients with LPI can present with a variety of symptoms, including kidney disease, autoimmune disorders, and bone abnormalities. A case report describes a 47-year-old Japanese woman with LPI who initially presented with renal tubular acidosis (RTA) and Fanconi syndrome, leading to rickets in childhood, and later developed autoimmune hemolytic anemia, epilepsy, and chronic kidney disease. Treatment included supplementation with vitamin D3, phosphate, and bicarbonate. Genetic analysis is crucial in diagnosing LPI, as symptoms can mimic other diseases. Diagnosis is important in cases of hyperammonemia, and high citrulline levels in newborn screening can aid in diagnosis. Kidney involvement in LPI is characterized by proximal tubular damage and various glomerular lesions. The study emphasizes the importance of considering LPI in the differential diagnosis of renal tubular diseases and highlights the role of comprehensive genetic analysis in diagnosing LPI.
