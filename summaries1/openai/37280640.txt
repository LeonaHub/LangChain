The text discusses the implementation of mandatory calorie labeling for large food businesses in England in 2022 to address issues of poor diet quality and obesity in the out-of-home food sector (OHFS). Research has shown that many consumers underestimate the energy content of OHFS food, leading to overconsumption. Studies have found that only a minority of businesses provide calorie labeling, and when present, it does not fully adhere to best practices. Customers tend to underestimate calorie content and only a small percentage notice and use calorie labels to make purchase decisions. Sociodemographic factors, such as gender and age, influence purchasing and consumption behavior in the OHFS. Lower socioeconomic status groups tend to consume more energy-dense, cheaper foods with lower nutritional value. The effectiveness of mandatory calorie labeling in influencing consumer behavior and public health is yet to be fully examined, with recommendations for clear and prominent presentation of calorie labeling to enhance noticing and use. Further research is needed to assess the impact of calorie labeling policies on reducing calorie consumption in the OHFS.
