The text discusses a case study of a rare tumor called clear cell myomelanocytic tumor (CCMMT), a type of perivascular epithelioid cell (PEComa) tumor, in a 29-year-old woman with liver cancer. It details the medical history, examination, imaging findings, surgical procedure, and pathological results of the tumor. The rarity of CCMMT is emphasized, along with the importance of accurate identification through histological and immunohistochemical analysis. The text also covers the clinical characteristics, imaging manifestations, pathological features, and differential diagnosis of PEComa tumors, including CCMMTs. Treatment typically involves surgical excision, with some cases responding to mTOR inhibitors, and long-term monitoring is necessary due to the potential for recurrence and metastasis. The study was approved by the Ethic Committee of the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University Medical College, with the patient providing written consent for publication.
