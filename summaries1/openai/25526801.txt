The text discusses the study of a thrombin inhibitor called hirudin, derived from leeches, and its recombinant version RGD-hirudin, which has been further modified through molecular simulations to create mutant variants. Various biochemical and biophysical methods were used to characterize these variants and study their interaction with thrombin. The study involved cloning, expression, and purification of RGD-hirudin and its mutants, as well as protein identification and testing for anti-thrombin and anti-platelet activities. Surface plasmon resonance analysis was used to study the binding of RGD-hirudin and its mutants with thrombin. The results showed that certain mutations, particularly Y3A, reduced anti-thrombin activity and binding affinity to thrombin. The study aimed to develop a more effective anticoagulant for post-anastomosis surgery. The text also delves into the structure of RGD-hirudin and its interaction with thrombin, emphasizing the importance of specific residues and hydrogen bonding interactions in inhibiting thrombin activity. The study suggests the potential for designing new antithrombin peptides for oral drugs to treat thrombotic diseases.
