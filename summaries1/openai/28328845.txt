Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a deadly cancer often diagnosed at advanced stages with high recurrence rates after surgery. A study focused on biomarkers BORIS and SOCS3 in liver lesions, including HCC, to clarify their prognostic relevance. Results suggest BORIS and SOCS3 as potential prognostic biomarkers for HCC. The study evaluated OS and DFS in HCC patients, showing higher BORIS expression in HCC tissues. High BORIS expression was linked to poor prognosis, while high SOCS3 expression was associated with a favorable prognosis. BORIS may act as a cancer stem cell marker and is involved in HCC recurrence. The combination of BORIS and SOCS3 expression provides better prognostic value, with patients having high BORIS and low SOCS3 expression showing the poorest survival outcomes. Further research is needed to understand the negative correlation between BORIS and SOCS3 and explore BORIS as a potential therapeutic target for HCC.
