The text discusses a study on glaucoma in monkeys, focusing on the relationship between intraocular pressure (IOP) and optic nerve head (ONH) connective tissue damage. The study uses histologic sections and digital reconstructions to analyze structural changes in the ONH and peripapillary neural and connective tissues. The researchers aim to quantify these changes using a 3D histomorphometric approach to understand individual susceptibility to glaucoma and develop new imaging techniques for early detection. The study found differences in lamina cribrosa thickness and position, scleral flange architecture, and peripapillary scleral thickness between normal and glaucomatous eyes. The findings suggest permanent deformation and thickening of connective tissues in early glaucoma stages, with implications for axonal susceptibility to damage. The study highlights the importance of accurately characterizing ONH and peripapillary scleral connective tissue architecture in understanding glaucoma progression and determining target intraocular pressure levels for treatment.
