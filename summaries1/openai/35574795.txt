The text discusses the synthesis and application of oligosaccharide-based high Ï‡-low N block copolymers (BCPs) for creating functional organic materials through hierarchical self-assembly. It explores the use of copper-catalyzed click chemistry to synthesize these BCPs and the impact of polarity differences between sub-blocks on self-assembly. The study delves into the effects of MeI and counterions on BCP self-assembly, as well as the role of supramolecular interactions in enhancing self-assembly. It also examines the influence of thermal treatment, counteranions, and molecular weights on nanostructure formation in BCPs. The text highlights the importance of controlling BCP orientation for efficient ionic transport and discusses the impact of solvent vapor annealing on film morphology and structure orientation. The study suggests that electrostatic interactions play a crucial role in achieving long-range ordered block copolymer thin films, showcasing potential applications in nanopatterning and ionic transport for energy storage.
