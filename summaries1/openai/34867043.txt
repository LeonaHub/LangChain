Breast cancer is a deadly disease with a high relapse rate and chemoresistance. Environmental pollutants like DMBA and TCDD can contribute to breast cancer through the AhR pathway. Metformin, an anti-hyperglycemic drug, shows promise as a chemopreventive agent by inhibiting the AhR/CYP1 pathway. A study on rats investigated the effects of DMBA and TCDD, and the protective effects of metformin. Metformin reduced AhR, CYP1A1, and CYP1B1 expression, restored apoptosis, and inhibited DNA damage and cell proliferation induced by DMBA. Metformin also reduced mammosphere formation and CYP1A1 expression in breast cancer cells. The study suggests metformin could be a potential chemopreventive agent against AhR-induced breast cancer in rats, primarily by inhibiting the AhR/CYP1A1 pathway. Further research is recommended to validate these findings.
