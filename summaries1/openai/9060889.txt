The text discusses a study that explores the use of intravenous dipyridamole during exercise testing to enhance the diagnostic value of myocardial single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in patients who cannot perform conventional exercise tests. The study protocol involved administering dipyridamole during exercise to patients with inadequate physical performance, aiming to improve diagnostic accuracy. Results showed that combining dipyridamole with exercise testing significantly improved sensitivity and negative predictive value of myocardial SPECT without losing prognostic data. This method allows for maximal vasodilation and improved cardiac image quality, making it beneficial for patients who cannot achieve adequate exercise levels or have contraindications to other stress agents.
