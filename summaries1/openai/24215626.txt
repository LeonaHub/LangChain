The text discusses the importance of growth as a measure of infant health and nutrition, particularly in relation to the addition of probiotics to infant formula. The European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) reviewed studies on probiotic-supplemented formula and concluded that they do not raise safety concerns regarding growth. A systematic review was conducted to update data on the effects of supplementing infant formula with specific probiotic strains on the growth of healthy infants, focusing on Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 (B lactis) and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG). The review included randomized controlled trials and found that supplementation with B lactis did not significantly impact infant growth compared to unsupplemented formula. However, data on LGG supplementation's effect on growth are limited. The text also highlights limitations in the studies, such as small sample sizes and methodological issues, emphasizing the need for further research to explore the potential anti-obesity effects of low-protein formulas and to assess the safety of infant products.
