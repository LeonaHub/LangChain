Glaucoma is a complex optic neuropathy associated with visual field loss and optic nerve degeneration, often linked to increased intraocular pressure. Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) is a common form of glaucoma, with genetic factors like mutations in the LTBP2 gene being implicated in its development. A study involving 54 PACG patients and one patient with pseudoexfoliation syndrome identified 24 sequence variations in the LTBP2 gene, with one novel coding variation potentially contributing to the disease. Bioinformatics tools were used to predict the effects of these variations on protein function, with one variation considered a potential candidate for association with PACG. The study underscores the significance of genetic factors in PACG, particularly in individuals of Asian ancestry, and recommends further research to explore the role of LTBP2 mutations in the disease and their impact on the extracellular matrix.
