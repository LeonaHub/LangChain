The text discusses the impact of COVID-19 globally and in Thailand, emphasizing the importance of preventive behaviors such as hand washing, mask-wearing, and physical distancing. It mentions the use of the PRECEDE model to identify factors influencing these behaviors among Thai people. A study conducted in Thailand analyzed factors influencing COVID-19 preventive behaviors among 6,521 participants, finding that social support, age, flu-like symptoms, gender, perceived risk of exposure, lockdown policy, and residential area were significant factors affecting preventive behaviors. Social support was identified as the most influential factor. The study used multiple regression analysis and found that these factors explained 10.6% of the variation in COVID-19 preventive behaviors. Education, health literacy, and access to COVID-19 information were found to be associated with engaging in COVID-19 preventive behaviors, while career was not significantly linked to these behaviors. Further research is suggested to explore these factors and develop tailored strategies to promote preventive behaviors effectively.
