The text discusses a study on GK rats as a model for diabetic nephropathy, focusing on the long-term effects of hyperglycemia and aging on renal lesions. The study found that GK rats exhibited renal lesions similar to human diabetic nephropathy, including mesangial cell proliferation, glomerulosclerosis, tubular lesions, and interstitial fibrosis. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed increased expression of Î±-SMA and type IV collagen, as well as macrophage infiltration. The study also highlighted that prolonged hyperglycemia may be a key factor in inducing renal damage in type 2 diabetes, with aging and obesity potentially exacerbating the condition. Despite changes, markers of end-stage renal failure did not worsen in GK rats compared to control Wistar rats within the experimental period.
