The text discusses the classification and genetic profiles of infiltrating/diffuse gliomas, emphasizing the significance of markers like IDH1 mutations and cMYC expression in predicting prognosis and therapeutic response. A study analyzed 171 gliomas from 156 patients, examining cMYC expression and its correlation with clinical and pathologic variables. The findings suggest an interaction between cMYC and IDH1 in glioma pathogenesis at the genetic level. The study utilized immunohistochemical data to investigate cMYC, IDH1, and p53 expression in gliomas, finding associations between cMYC expression, IDH1 mutation, and p53 expression in malignant gliomas. cMYC expression was linked to strong p53 expression and mutant IDH1, impacting survival based on IDH1 mutation status. The text also explores the potential role of cMYC and IDH1 in gliomagenesis and aberrant metabolism. Further research is needed to fully understand the prognostic value of cMYC expression in gliomas at different levels.
