A study conducted at a Queensland hospital focused on ileostomy patients, particularly examining readmission rates, factors influencing ileostomy reversal, and changes in blood test results. The retrospective cohort study included 171 patients, with a 38% readmission rate within 60 days of discharge. Factors such as dehydration and acute kidney injury were common causes of readmission, with loop ileostomies more likely to be reversed than end ileostomies. The study highlighted the impact of ileostomy formation on renal function, emphasizing the increased risk of kidney injury, dehydration, and acute kidney injury following the procedure. The association between serum sodium levels, dehydration, and readmission rates in ileostomy patients was also noted. The study suggested the need for further research to better understand and manage the risks associated with ileostomy procedures to preserve renal function in these patients.
