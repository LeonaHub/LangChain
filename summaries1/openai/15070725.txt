The text discusses the gene 4 protein in the T7 bacteriophage system, focusing on its helicase and primase activities during DNA replication. The protein acts as a hexamer on single-stranded DNA, translocating unidirectionally using dTTP hydrolysis energy. The crystal structures of the helicase fragment reveal key amino acids involved in catalytic function, including the proposed "arginine finger" Arg-522. Various assays were conducted to study the biochemical properties of the gene 4 protein, revealing insights into its interactions and functions in DNA replication. Experiments showed that alterations in subunits, particularly the loss of Arg-522, significantly impact dTTPase activity and DNA unwinding. The importance of Vi inhibition, minimal DNA-unwinding activity for DNA synthesis support, and the role of Arg-522 in nucleotide binding and conformational changes across subunit interfaces were highlighted. The text also discusses a binding change mechanism for NTP hydrolysis and the impact of Arg-522 on nucleotide binding and coupling of dTTP hydrolysis and DNA unwinding activities.
