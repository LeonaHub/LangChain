The text discusses the importance of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) in gene transcription initiation and regulation in eukaryotes by recognizing and binding promoter TATA sequences. It highlights the complex binding mechanisms and helical distortions induced by TBP, such as DNA bending and unwinding. The text compares TBPs from different species, emphasizing the conserved C-terminal DNA binding domains and varying N-terminal domains. Research focuses on kinetic models for TBP binding to different TATA sequences and evaluating the solution structure of TBP-DNA complexes. Studies show TATA sequence-dependent DNA bend angles in solution complexes, contrasting with crystalline TBP-DNA complexes. Experimental studies on human TBP (hTBP) and yeast TBP (yTBP) interactions with DNA reveal differences in binding affinity, kinetics, and bend angles induced. The text also discusses the use of time-resolved decays to determine distances and bend angles in DNA duplexes bound by TBPs, highlighting differences in interactions between hTBP and yTBP. The implications of these findings for cellular functioning and the mechanisms of TBP-DNA binding and bending in promoter recognition are emphasized. The text also questions proposed models and raises concerns about reported binding affinities and the impact of mutant TBPs on DNA binding and bending activity.
