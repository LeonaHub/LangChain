The text describes the development and implementation of the Shared Decision Making â€” Renal Supportive Care (SDM-RSC) intervention to enhance end-of-life care for dialysis patients with kidney failure. The HIGHway project aims to expand the SDM-RSC intervention by training social workers or nurses in 50 clinics to conduct advance care planning (ACP) conversations using best practices. The project involves collaboration with major dialysis organizations to implement ACP on a larger scale, including home dialysis patients and telehealth options. The intervention focuses on person-centered approaches, empathy, and the use of a computer application for documentation. The project aims to improve communication quality, fidelity checks, and patient survey responses to ensure preference-concordant care for dialysis patients. The success of the intervention will be measured through various outcomes, and the project team plans to address barriers through creative problem-solving and stakeholder input to scale up ACP in dialysis centers across the US.
