Collagen is a vital protein found in vertebrates, utilized in various industries like food, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics. Traditional collagen sources like pig and cattle have safety concerns, leading researchers to explore collagen from aquatic species like the soft-shelled turtle. A study focused on quality control of soft-shelled turtle collagen identified specific peptide biomarkers using mass spectrometry techniques to authenticate and trace collagen products. Another study analyzed sea cucumber tissue samples, identifying specific peptide sequences with post-translational modifications as biomarkers for sea cucumber identification. Peptidomics analysis identified specific peptide biomarkers for authenticating sea turtle gelatin, distinguishing it from other types of gelatins. These studies highlight the potential of aquatic species collagen as safe alternatives to traditional sources, ensuring product quality and safety.
