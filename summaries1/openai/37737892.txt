Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection can lead to neurological symptoms, such as neuralgic amyotrophy and Guillain–Barré syndrome, in addition to typical gastrointestinal symptoms. A study conducted at Ulm University's Department of Neurology analyzed patients with neurological conditions associated with HEV infection, revealing potential associations between HEV and neurological manifestations. The study included detailed case studies of patients with extrahepatic HEV manifestations, such as neuritis and encephalitis, and found a significant link between HEV infection and certain neurological conditions. Treatment typically involved corticosteroids and symptomatic management. The text also discusses the challenges in diagnosing and treating these conditions, emphasizing the need for further research and larger studies to explore the long-term effects of HEV infection on neurological diseases. The study suggests considering HEV in unusual neurological cases and highlights the importance of testing for HEV in patients with neurological symptoms to uncover potential links with clinical manifestations.
