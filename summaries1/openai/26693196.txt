Glaucoma, particularly Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG), is a leading cause of irreversible blindness globally, often undiagnosed until advanced stages. In Ghana, where glaucoma prevalence is high, awareness and knowledge among individuals aged 40 and above are crucial for early detection. A study at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Ghana found that early diagnosis is vital for better outcomes, emphasizing the need for improved public education to reduce late-stage diagnoses and blindness. Another study in Kumasi, Ghana, revealed that while 74% of participants were aware of glaucoma, knowledge levels were low and often inaccurate. Higher education was associated with increased awareness, suggesting a need for targeted education efforts, especially for those with lower socioeconomic status. The study recommends further community-based research to assess glaucoma awareness and knowledge more broadly.
