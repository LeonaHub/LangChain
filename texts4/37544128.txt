Introduction
Workplace bullying (WPB) is a pervasive issue that is considered one of the greatest threats to the well-being of workers.
1
,
2
 WPB involves persistent (at least 6 months) and repeated (at least once a week) negative behaviours directed towards an individual or group of employees.
3
 It has been estimated that between 15% and 95% of employees experience WPB at some point in their careers, with varying physical and mental health impacts.
4
,
5
 These negative behaviours can take different forms, including verbal abuse, humiliation, exclusion, and physical aggression.
6
 WPB can be classified into three types, from the top down (employers against employees), from the bottom up (employees against employers), or horizontally (employees against employees), based on the source of the bullying.
3

Growing empirical evidence suggests that WPB is an important social concern that not only has an impact on victims' physical and mental health but also has persistent negative impacts on organisations and the society.
7
 WPB can impair physical health, such as headaches, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and suicide and affect mental health, including anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress, burnout, and more.
8
 From the organisation's standpoint, WPB increases the likelihood of employee sick leave and turnover and reduces job satisfaction and productivity. In addition, the development of the organisation is hindered.
9
 Statistics from the World Health Organization show that suicide has become the third most frequent cause of death worldwide, with one person committing suicide every 40 s.
10
 Cumulative exposure to work psychosocial stressors may lead to suicide. WPB is a particular psychological stressor that can lead to hopelessness, worthlessness, social exclusion, and psychological distress.
11
 A large prospective study in Denmark found that individuals exposed to WPB had a higher risk of suicidal behaviour than those who did not report WPB.
12
 Additionally, a cohort study of Norwegian workers confirmed that WPB was significantly associated with subsequent suicidal ideation after adjustment for sociodemographic factors and suicidal ideation at baseline.
13

Given the severe impact of suicide, many models had been developed to explain the cause and process of suicide.
14
 The integrated motivational–volitional (IMV) model of suicidal behaviour provides a theoretical foundation for how exposure to WPB may be related to suicidal ideation and behaviour.
15
 The theory suggests that every individual has an innate vulnerability that is activated when stress is perceived (i.e. experiencing WPB).
15
 The IMV model explains the causes and processes of suicidal ideation and behaviour through three phases. Phase 1 (the premotivational phase) includes background factors and triggering events. In the current study, WPB is regarded as the triggering event. Phase 2 (the motivational phase) includes suicidal ideation and intention formation; repeated and chronic exposure to WPB can put individuals into a desperate situation leading to suicidal ideation and behaviour. Notably, mediating or moderating factors that reduce or increase suicidal ideation exist during this phase. In phase 3 (the volitional phase), accumulation of suicidal ideation increases, eventually resulting in suicide.

While WPB and suicide are major public health issues, the extent to which WPB is associated with suicidal ideation and behaviour remains unclear. A systematic review by Leach et al.
16
 in 2017 provided strong evidence that WPB is associated with greater suicidal ideation; however, due to the limited number of studies that have explored this association, the authors did not conduct further exploration of the magnitude of this association. Accordingly, the current review aimed to determine the extent to which WPB contributes to suicidal ideation and behaviour, independent of sociodemographic factors and other psychosocial work-related factors. In addition, this study investigates the prevalence, mediators, and moderators, and a theoretical framework for WPB suicidal ideation and behaviour to provide direction for future research. This knowledge is required to infer how reductions in WPB may lead to a reduction in the prevalence of suicidal ideation and behaviour.

Methods
This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.
17
 The international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO) registration number is CRD42022379717.

Search strategy
This study systematically searched for published literature using nine electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, PsycINFO, ProQuest, Scopus, CBM, CNKI, and WANFANG) from database inception until 5 November 2022. The search strategy included every possible combination of the three sets of keywords. The first group comprised the keywords ‘Workplace’, ‘Occupational’, and ‘Job’. The second group comprised the keywords ‘Bullying’, ‘Mobbing’, and ‘Harassment’. The third group comprised the keyword ‘Suicid∗’. The detailed search strategy can be seen in Supplement File S1. In addition, manual screening of the reference lists of related systematic reviews or meta-analyses and a free search in Google Scholar was conducted for any further potential literature.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The inclusion criteria were the following:
(i)
Population: various employees.

(ii)
Exposure: reported measure of WPB or similar behaviours (mobbing or harassment);

(iii)
Outcomes: reported measure of suicidal ideation or behaviour;

(iv)
The publication language was limited to English or Chinese.


The exclusion criteria were the following:
(i)
Articles of qualitative reports, experts' opinions, meeting summary, reviews (literature, systematic);

(ii)
Full texts unavailable or duplicate publications.


Study selection and data extraction
Rayyan (web application) was used to screen the literature, and duplicates were removed through Endnote 20.
18
 Two rounds of double-blind literature selection were conducted. First, two reviewers independently assessed the titles and abstracts for eligibility. Second, the full text of the remaining studies was read carefully against all inclusion criteria; studies had to provide information about the association between WPB and suicide. Finally, the following information was extracted: descriptive information (author, year of publication, country, sample size and type, age, measurement tool, the forms and prevalence of WPB and suicide), mediator, moderator, and theory. Furthermore, the odds ratios (ORs) or hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were also recorded.

Quality assessment
Quality assessment of the selected studies was performed by two reviewers independently, with any discrepancies resolved by consensus. The methodological quality of the included cross-sectional studies was assessed using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which includes 11 items;
19
,
20
 scores ranged from 0 to 11 points, with ≥8 points defined as high quality. The Newcastle–Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale was used to assess cohort and case-control studies;
21
 scores ranged from 0 to 9 points, with ≥7 points classified as high quality.
22

Data synthesis
A qualitative systematic review was conducted based on the content of the included articles. A meta-analysis was performed with STATA software (version 16.0) from pooled estimates of the main results from all studies. If there were many adjusted effect sizes provided in the same article, the most fully adjusted effect size was chosen for pooling. The Q statistic was used to assess the heterogeneity of studies, and the I2 statistic was computed as an indicator of heterogeneity in percentages. When the I2 was <50%, indicating low heterogeneity, a fixed-effects model was used; otherwise, a random-effects model was used.
23
 Subgroup analyses were conducted to further explore the potential sources of heterogeneity. Sensitivity analysis was carried out using the leave-one-out method, which aimed to assess the susceptibility of the findings of this meta-analysis. In addition, publication bias was assessed using the Begg's and Egger's tests. P < 0.05 was considered significant.

Results
Search results summary
Fig. 1
 shows the process of literature screening and selection in a PRISMA flow chart. In total, 1702 relevant articles were initially identified, and 739 duplicates were then excluded. After screening the titles and abstracts, 902 articles were excluded because they were nonrelevant research. In the full-text evaluation stage, 21 articles were removed as they did not meet the inclusion criteria, 14 nonrelevant articles were excluded, and one article was excluded due to the lack of full-text access. Finally, 25 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis and 15 of these were included in the meta-analysis.

Most studies (K, number of studies = 13; n, number of respondents = 32,998) measured WPB based on the past 6 months, although five articles did not report the measure time. In total, 12 articles used a self-administered questionnaire to measure WPB, and six articles used the Negative Act Questionnaire. More than half of the articles (K = 15) did not distinguish between specific forms of WPB. The overall prevalence of WPB varied from 6.3% to 100%. In terms of the specific forms of WPB, the prevalence ranged from 1.1% for physically intimidating behaviours to 30.2% for degrading experiences/harassment.

The majority of studies (K = 13; n = 203,744) did not report the timepoints of suicidal ideation or behaviour measurement; however, of the studies that did report timepoints of suicidal ideation or behaviour measurement, nine studies measured suicidal ideation or behaviour over the past 12 months. Suicidal ideation or behaviour was reported based on self-report questionnaires (K = 13), register data (K = 2),
12

26
 and validated suicide scales (all remaining studies). Suicidal ideation was evaluated as a primary outcome measure in 16 studies, suicidal behaviour in two studies,

26
 and five studies evaluated both suicidal ideation and behaviour.

The fifth column in 
Table 1
 shows the number of quality indicators present in each study. All of the included articles were considered to be of medium or high quality; for the cross-sectional research, three articles had a high score, three of the five prospective cohort studies had high quality, and the case-control study was of moderate quality (
Tables S1, S2 and S3
).

Results of the meta-analysis
A total of 15 studies provided an effect size to assess the association between WPB and suicidal ideation and behaviour, including crude/adjusted ORs or HRs, and prevalence. In total, nine articles provided both crude ORs (CORs) and adjusted ORs (AORs) for the relationship between WPB and suicidal ideation; three studies provided only crude ORs, and one provided only adjusted ORs. In the current meta-analysis, the pooled crude OR for suicidal ideation under WPB using a random-effects model was 3.02 (95% CI: 2.39−3.65, I2 = 85.04%) (
Figure S1
); this association remained after fully adjusting for potential covariates (AOR = 2.03, 95% CI: 1.48−2.58, I2 = 56.92%) (
Figure S2
). Most studies (K = 18; n = 38,320) reported prevalence of suicidal ideation after WPB, with a pooled mean prevalence of 18% (95% CI: 11%–25%, I2 = 99.85%) using a random-effects model (
Figure S3
 and 
Table 3
).

 including crude/adjusted ORs and HRs, and another study provided both crude and adjusted ORs.
34
 In this meta-analysis, it was found that, compared to their counterparts with non-exposure to WPB, individuals experiencing WPB had 2.71-times higher odds of suicidal behaviour (COR = 2.71, 95% CI: 1.01−4.42, I2 = 95.72%) (
Figure S4
). However, after adjusting for the confounding factors, this relationship became nonsignificant (AOR = 2.68, 95% CI: 0.00−5.39, I2 = 77.50%) (
Figure S4
). Furthermore, the pooled HR from prospective cohort studies showed that individuals who experienced WPB were 1.71-times more likely to commit suicide than those who did not experience WPB (95% CI: 1.39−2.02, I2 = 0.00%) (
Figure S5
), and this association was stable and remained after adjustment for potential confounding factors (AHR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.34−1.99, I2 = 0.00%) (
Figure S5
). Seven studies reported the prevalence of suicidal behaviour after exposure to WPB, with a pooled mean prevalence of 4% (95% CI: 1%–8%, I2 = 99.97%) using a random-effects model (
Figure S6
 and 
Table 3
).

The subgroup analysis showed the pooled estimates of gender, marital status, and continent of study for suicidal ideation. Compared to males, females may be more susceptible to suicidal ideation when exposed to WPB (COR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.51−0.82, I2 = 33.72%); however, after adjustment for confounders, this association was no longer significant (AOR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.48−1.02, I2 = 0.00%) (
Figure S7
). Marital status showed no significant effect on suicidal ideation (COR = 1.61, 95% CI: 0.66−2.56, I2 = 86.25%) (
Figure S7
). The results of the subgroup analysis by continent where each study was performed (Europe, Oceania, or Asia) are provided in 
Table 4
, and details are shown in 
Figures S8–S10
. In terms of suicidal behaviour, subgroup analyses were conducted according to male, female, and studies from Europe (
Figure S11
–
Figure S12
). Even when controlling for all identified confounders, males were more likely to commit suicide than females over time (male: AHR = 2.27, 95% CI: 1.44−3.09, I2 = 11.66%; female: AHR = 1.33, 95% CI: 0.98−1.68, I2 = 0.00%) (
Figure S11
).

Sensitivity analysis and publication bias
In the sensitivity analyses, the pooled mean effect size for suicidal ideation did not change significantly when each study was excluded from the analysis (
Figures S13−S15
). The results of Egger's publication bias test for the crude or adjusted effect size of suicidal ideation were P = 0.126 and P = 0.274, respectively. Hence, there was no evident publication bias; however, analysis of the prevalence of suicidal ideation may be subject to publication bias (P = 0.008) (
Figures S16−S18
).

Moderators, mediators, and theories
A multitude of moderators and mediators that impact the association between WPB and suicide ideation were identified (
Table 5
). Three studies indicated four factors that mediate the WPB effects on suicidal ideation
37
,
38
,
44
 and two studies provided two moderators between WPB and suicide ideation.
25
,
43
 The interpersonal theory of suicide (ITS) provides a suitable explanation for why it is possible for WPB to cause suicidal ideation.
48
 ITS concludes that an individual may develop a desire to die when they experience prolonged social alienation or perceive themselves as a burden to others.
49
 Chronic exposure to bullying and social exclusion from supervisors or colleagues at work is a risk factor for suicidal ideation. In the IMV model of suicidal behaviour, exposure to WPB is a triggering event for suicidal behaviour,
44
 which brings feelings of defeat and entrapment, resulting in suicidal behaviour when the individual fails to self-regulate.

Discussion
Overall, this study quantitatively assessed the association of WPB with suicidal ideation and behaviour and comprehensively summarised the possible mediating and moderating variables in the relationship. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first review to evaluate the magnitude of association between exposure to WPB and suicidal ideation and behaviour. The strengths of the study were as follows: (1) all relevant studies were included from nine electronic literature databases up to 5 November 2022; (2) epidemiological studies investigating the relationship between WPB and suicidal thoughts and behaviours (i.e., prospective cohort studies or case control studies) were included; and (3) the study pooled crude and adjusted effect sizes separately, increasing the stability of the meta-analysis results.

Magnitude of the association between exposure to WPB and suicidal ideation and behaviour
In the present study, the magnitude of the association of WPB on suicide was investigated based on previous studies. The results of this review suggest that individuals who reported WPB had greater odds of reporting thoughts and behaviours about suicide than those who did not report WPB. The association remained statistically significant after controlling, as much as possible, for a comprehensive set of covariates, suggesting that WPB maintains an independent influence. Nielsen et al. found that increased suicidal ideation remained two and five years after bullying, but there was no association between suicidal ideation and subsequent risk of being bullied (reverse causality),
13
,
50
 these findings echo the study by Leach et al.
40
 These results suggest that the effect of WPB is persistent and is not restricted to the time or place it occurs. WPB reduces an individual's sense of belonging, leading to cumulative negative feelings and gradually, potentially suicidal ideation.
38
,
51
 The appearance and deepening of suicidal ideation will increase the risk of suicidal behaviour and finally result in suicidal behaviour through self-injury.
52
 Glenn et al. highlighted that it takes 9–12 months for the transition from suicidal ideation to specific suicide plan and about 18–24 months for the transition from suicidal ideation to suicide attempt after exposure to WPB.
53

Different measures of exposure and outcome were used in the studies included in the current review, which may potentially have influenced the findings. There was high heterogeneity between studies; thus, subgroup analysis was conducted to identify the source of heterogeneities. Significant difference existed between males and females in suicidal ideation. Although previous research studies have failed to find a statistical difference between the genders,
33
,
34
,
41
 one study of 7860 physicians in the US found that female physicians were less likely to report suicidal thoughts than male physicians.
39
 This may be attributed to the subtypes and intensities of bullying experienced across different professional environments.

It should be noted that for most studies, the measures of WPB and suicidal ideation and behaviour were based on the subjective responses of participants.
54
 WPB and suicidal ideation and behaviour is often a subjective experience; therefore, self-reporting methods can provide insights into the subjective experiences and perceptions of bullying victims, capture the authentic experiences of individuals, and gather data from a large sample size, providing a broader understanding of the prevalence and impact of WPB.
55
 On the other hand, self-reporting methods are susceptible to participants’ subjective biases. Bullying victims may overemphasise or underestimate the extent of their bullying experiences, or they may be influenced by memory biases.
56
 Future studies that combine multiple research methods (e.g., observation, interviews) and longitudinal designs to obtain a more comprehensive and reliable understanding of the association between WPB and suicidal ideation or behaviour are thus highly anticipated. In the forest plots, a categorical pool of the crude and adjusted effect sizes was selected. In models adjusted for covariates, the most fully adjusted effect sizes for pooling, including demographic sociological variables, work-related variables, and mental health–related variables were chosen. The main rational for this method was that the model adjusted for different potential confounders made the results more stable.

Mediating and moderating variables in the relationship between WPB and suicidal ideation and behaviour
Importantly, this study identified several factors that moderate or mediate the risk for WPB and suicidal ideation. According to the ITS, the desire to die develops when the sense of belonging is not fulfilled.
57
 Perceived severe burdensomeness can lead to suicidal ideation; hence, reducing perceived burden is effective in reducing levels of self-loathing and suicidal ideation associated with exposure and WPB.
58
 Based on the conservation of resources theory, the moderating factors were divided into two categories: social/organisational resources and personal resources. Hobfoll
59
 argued that beliefs in resilience can be augmented by social/organisational resources, and accumulated personal resources can counteract the energy-depleting spiral. Treatment can effectively reduce the frustrating sense of belonging and suicidal ideation caused by exposure to WPB. In addition, females have higher levels of self-efficacy and self-compassion than males. These personal or socio/organizational resources enable individuals to discover the positive meaning of work; effectively identify, process, and manage emotions; and ultimately successfully deal with negative emotional situations.
60

Limitations
This study has some limitations. First, approximately 80% of the included studies used a cross-sectional design; therefore, causality cannot be inferred. Second, most of the associations between WPB and suicidal ideation and behaviour were based on self-reported data. Considering the shame and guilt that may accompany WPB and suicide, synthesised research findings may underestimate the strength of the association between the two. In addition, the existing disparities in sample types and assessments of WPB and suicidal ideation and behaviours hinder the ability to accurately understand the relationship between exposure factors and outcome indicators. However, despite variations in assessment tools, the consistent positive correlation found between WPB and suicidal ideation across diverse samples from various countries suggests that this association is universal and pervasive. Hence, it is important that more prospective studies are conducted in the future that can assess the relationship between WPB and suicide while controlling for a variety of confounding factors.

Conclusions
Based on the research by Leach et al., this review further explored the prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviour after experiencing WPB, the magnitude of association between WPB and suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviour, mediating or moderating factors, and theories guiding suicide research. In the current study, individuals experiencing WPB were twice as likely to report thoughts and behaviour about suicide as their nonexposed counterparts. While the data varied across continents, it remained statistically significant. In addition, this study pooled the prevalence of suicidal ideation and behaviour exposure to WPB and summarised the factors that mediate or mediate the relationship. Overall, the results of this study are important and provide new insights for future studies on the consequences of exposure to WPB.
