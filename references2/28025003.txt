ω-Hydroxy polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), natural metabolites from arachidonic acid (ARA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were prepared via convergent synthesis approach using two key steps: Cu-mediated C-C bond formation to construct methylene skipped poly-ynes and a partial alkyne hydrogenation where the presence of excess 2-methyl-2-butene as an additive that is proven to be critical for the success of partial reduction of the poly-ynes to the corresponding cis-alkenes without over-hydrogenation. The potential biological function of ω-hydroxy PUFAs in pain was evaluated in naive rats. Following intraplantar injection, 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE, ω-hydroxy ARA) generated an acute decrease in paw withdrawal thresholds in a mechanical nociceptive assay indicating pain, but no change was observed from rats which received either 20-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (20-HEPE, ω-hydroxy EPA) or 22-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (22-HDoHE, ω-hydroxy DHA). We also found that both 20-HEPE and 22-HDoHE are more potent than 20-HETE to activate murine transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor1 (mTRPV1).
