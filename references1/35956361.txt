We aimed to investigate dietary vitamin A (DVA) intake, serum vitamin A (SVA) concentrations, and breast milk vitamin A (BMVA) concentrations of urban lactating Chinese women and explore the associated factors. We recruited 326 lactating women from ten cities in China and collected their dietary information, blood samples, and breast milk samples. SVA and BMVA were assessed with high-performance liquid chromatography. Mann–Whitney U tests, Kruskal–Wallis H tests, Chi-square tests, Spearman correlation tests, and multiple regression analyses were conducted. The median (25th, 75th) of DVA, SVA and BMVA were 372.36 (209.12, 619.78) μg RAE/day, 1.99 (1.71, 2.35) μmol/L, and 1.67 (1.13, 2.15) μmol/L, respectively. Only 3.1% of lactating women met the recommended nutrient intake of Vitamin A (VA), and 20.6% had a BMVA level below 1.05 μmol/L. Compared to underweight or normal weight women, overweight or obese lactating women had lower DVA and BMVA but higher SVA (p = 0.022; p = 0.030; p = 0.003). Multiparous women had a higher risk of inadequate BMVA (p = 0.023) than primiparous women. SVA and BMVA were positively associated with DVA, especially for lactating women not using VA supplements (β = 0.174, 95%CI = 0.025, 0.324, p = 0.022; β = 0.501, 95%CI = 0.208, 0.795, p = 0.001). There was no association between SVA and BMVA (β = 0.165, 95%CI = −0.037, 0.366, p = 0.109). In conclusion, VA nutritional status among Chinese urban lactating women needs more attention, especially for those who are obese, overweight, or higher parity. Increased DVA may contribute to increased BMVA.
