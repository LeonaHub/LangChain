The aim was to test the hypothesis that left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) activation from body surface electrical mapping (CardioInsight 252-electrode vest, Medtronic) identifies optimal cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) pacing strategies and outcomes in 30 patients. The LV80, RV80, and BIV80 were defined as the times to 80% LV, RV, or biventricular electrical activation. Smaller differences in the LV80 and RV80 (|LV80-RV80|) with synchronized LV pacing predicted better LV function post-CRT (p = 0.0004) than the LV-paced QRS duration (p = 0.32). Likewise, a lower RV80 was associated with a better pre-CRT RV ejection fraction by CMR (r =  − 0.40, p = 0.04) and predicted post-CRT improvements in myocardial oxygen uptake (p = 0.01) better than the biventricular-paced QRS (p = 0.38), while a lower LV80 with BIV pacing predicted lower post-CRT B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) (p = 0.02). RV pacing improved LV function with smaller |LV80-RV80| (p = 0.009). In conclusion, 3-D electrical mapping predicted favorable post-CRT outcomes and informed effective pacing strategies.
