Because of continual generation of new variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), it is critical to design the next generation of vaccines to combat the threat posed by SARS-CoV-2 variants. We developed human adenovirus (HAd) vector-based vaccines (HAd-Spike/C5 and HAd-Spike) that express the whole Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 with or without autophagy-inducing peptide C5 (AIP-C5), respectively. Mice or golden Syrian hamsters immunized intranasally (i.n.) with HAd-Spike/C5 induced similar levels of S-specific humoral immune responses and significantly higher levels of S-specific cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses compared with HAd-Spike vaccinated groups. These results indicated that inclusion of AIP-C5 induced enhanced S-specific CMI responses and similar levels of virus-neutralizing titers against SARS-CoV-2 variants. To investigate the protection efficacy, golden Syrian hamsters immunized i.n. either with HAd-Spike/C5 or HAd-Spike were challenged with SARS-CoV-2. The lungs and nasal turbinates were collected 3, 5, 7, and 14 days post challenge. Significant reductions in morbidity, virus titers, and lung histopathological scores were observed in immunized groups compared with the mock- or empty vector-inoculated groups. Overall, slightly better protection was seen in the HAd-Spike/C5 group compared with the HAd-Spike group.
