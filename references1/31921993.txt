Introduction
Medical student mistreatment continues to be a significant problem despite increased awareness and longitudinal efforts to address the issue. Through audience discussions of a previously published film depicting learner mistreatment, we identified challenges created by student behaviors that negatively impact the learning environment. In addition, the need to address cultural competency in a multigenerational clinical environment became apparent.

Methods
We created a film of three vignettes based on perspectives shared in focus groups by faculty, residents, nurses, and staff who work with medical students. We used this film to develop student and faculty curricula elucidating generational differences in behaviors and expectations while also exploring the learner's role in creating a more positive learning environment.

Results
Our film was presented to medical education professionals at faculty development workshops and meetings, clerkship students at orientation sessions, residents as part of residents-as-teachers curricula, and faculty at departmental grand rounds. Evaluation data from 176 students and 42 faculty showed that a majority of our participants believed the film accurately reflected challenges they faced in the learning environment and felt better equipped to address them.

Discussion
Film is an effective way to stimulate discussion about complex interactions in the clinical learning environment. Divergent perspectives on behaviors depicted in the film served as a stimulus to create targeted curricula for faculty and student education. Stimulating dialogue through film may enhance understanding and empathy among disparate groups, which is likely to be a necessary step for lasting change.
