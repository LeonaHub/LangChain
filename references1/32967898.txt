Seasonal influenza virus is associated with high morbidity and mortality especially in vulnerable patient populations. Here, we demonstrate the novel use of Sofia influenza A+B fluorescent immunoassay (FIA), a rapid antigen-based influenza point-of-care test (POCT), combined with Virena software for automatic deidentified tracking of influenza activity across the Los Angeles area and for predicting surges of influenza cases in the emergency department (ED). We divided outpatient clinics into 6 geographic zones and compared weekly influenza activity. In the outpatient setting, there were 1,666 and 274 influenza A and influenza B positives, respectively, across the 2018 to 2019 influenza season and 1,857 and 1,449 influenza A and influenza B positives, respectively, during the 2019 to 2020 influenza season, with zone-specific differences observed. Moreover, we found that a rapid increase in outpatient influenza was followed by an influx in influenza-positive cases in the ED, offering a 1- to 3-week warning sign for ED influx of triple or quadruple the number of influenza cases compared to the prior week. Sofia influenza A+B FIA allows for surveillance of real-time deidentified influenza activity. Tracking of such data may serve as a valuable region-specific influenza indicator and predictor to guide infection prevention measures in both the outpatient and hospital settings. High-impact interventions include designating areas for waiting rooms for influenza-like illnesses, altering staff scheduling in anticipation of surges, and securing sufficient personal protective equipment and antivirals during the height of influenza season.
